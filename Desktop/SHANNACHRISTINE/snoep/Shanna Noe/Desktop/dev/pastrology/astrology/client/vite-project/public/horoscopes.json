Saturn is bringing more maturity to your character and organization to your life with its relatively new transit of your sign, and today, your emotions are engaged. Working on longer-term projects that don't have immediate dividends, whether material or spiritual, makes sense now. Saturn recently began its transit of your sign, where it will visit until September 1st and then from February 2026 to April 2028. It's a time for gaining more maturity and restructuring your life in meaningful ways. You\u2019ll be attending to those things you\u2019ve left unfinished or neglected, and you may need to retrain or learn new skills. It\u2019s a powerful period for stabilizing and strengthening key areas of your life. The focus is now on structure and firmer foundations. You're discovering that you can hold your own!

It's a fabulous time for pouring energies into a passion project, heartfelt pursuit, and possibly a romance or getaway. Still, the month of May features special attention to improving your sense of stability and comfort. It's a powerful period for embracing your need to sometimes indulge and enjoy yourself. \n Where you felt constricted in recent months, you have a strong sense of liberation and forward movement in May. People want to be around you \u2013 they seek out your company. Your ruler, Mars, is working in harmony with your sign all of May, reinvigorating and energizing you. \n Still, Pluto turns retrograde on the 4th, signaling some need to de-emphasize networking a little. Plans, obligations, and concerns regarding your social life, friendships, or happiness goals may have heavy energy hanging over them during the shift in the first week of May. However, as the retrograde advances, things not only even out but also feel less pressured. This retrograde period lasts until October, and it\u2019s powerful for taking a step back and examining your fears, resentments, and possible self-destructive tendencies so that you\u2019re not living on autopilot. It\u2019s a vital time for healing. \n You can be motivated to develop projects and focus on building something special this month. You are working smartly now, finding ways to do what you need to do without impinging too much on your personal time. Your powers of attraction are super as Venus spends the entire month in your sign. You\u2019re feeling stronger, more content, and happy with yourself, and as this reflects outward, you\u2019re bound to see improvement in your relationships with others. You can be attracting love and money in May. \n With the Sun in your solar second house until the 20th and Mercury here from the 10th to the 25th, a good part of you is focused on comfort, finances, security, and settling in. It\u2019s a time to enjoy what you have and patiently build or strengthen. \n With Mars in your sector of fun, creativity, and romance all month, you\u2019re in strong touch with your passions. You\u2019re expressing yourself confidently. Romantic relationships may be animated, or your feelings for someone fire up. There can certainly be competing energies between the drive for security and a need to put yourself out there. For the most part, however, you can make this work. \n The Full Moon on the 12th can bring your attention to matters of sharing or connecting intimately with a partner, and it may ask you to take an emotional risk or move out of your comfort zone. It\u2019s a time for handling debts or matters of support. \n Your instincts for what works best for you are in top form for much of the month, and you can feel moved and motivated to up your game or rise to a personal challenge. You feel freer to express your authentic self through your writings, ideas, and personal interests. It\u2019s a powerful time for healing through the power of words, better communication, or expanded personal interests. \n The month can bring stellar money-making or project ideas with long-term appeal and profitability. As much as you're seeking more predictability, you can have a sudden desire for a fancy new item or new technology in your everyday life that changes your methods or mood is likely. The urge to unburden yourself of excess possessions or clutter can be as strong. Circumstances are such that you become incredibly aware of what you\u2019ve been holding onto both emotionally and physically, and it becomes clear how some of this may be holding you back in key areas of your life. Money matters can surprise you this month. \n From the 20th forward, you're in a period that's strong for new interests, a busy mind, and learning or studying. You\u2019re in great shape for increased self-acceptance and enjoyment, and possibly for learning new things about yourself or someone important to you. \n The last days of May point to a mentally busy period and a potentially illuminating time. You\u2019re in a particularly good position to sort things out and solve problems or to gain some clarity on your studies, trips, or projects as new details emerge. It\u2019s a good time for engaging in helpful conversations and arriving at interesting ideas. \n More: \n Monthly Horoscopes \u2013 Details \n \n \u00a0 \n This Year: Aries \n 2025  Overview \n Jupiter continues to open the lines of communication in your life this year, dear Aries. Later, it boosts your home and family life. \n From June forward, although Jupiter will square your sign, this planet of abundance will feed your sense of security and stability, which can be comforting, especially with both Saturn and Neptune visiting your sign in 2025. While they\u2019re not yet consistent guests, you\u2019re getting the message that things must change. There will be times when you will need to slow\u00a0yourself down and choose your battles wisely. \n You are moving away from false paths that no longer serve you well or transform them into more suitable ones. Still, you have plenty of opportunities to find comfort at home or with family this year. In fact, this is a year in which the major key to success is learning when it\u2019s time to slow down. While it\u2019s a signature Aries trait, Impulsiveness should be tamed somewhat in 2025. You first get this cosmic message with Mars, your ruler, retrograde until February 23rd. Then, Venus turns retrograde in your sign on March 1st. Love and romance are unlikely to make headlines for you this year (2026 is more likely to be a year of change in this department). However, status quo can also work out well. \n Relationships with siblings and possibly neighbors can be stimulating and even healing, and activities close to home (and on or in the home) are highly appealing now. The need or desire for roomier or happier living conditions can come over you from June forward. If circumstances allow, this can be an exciting time to launch new projects or even a business, opening up a world of possibilities. \n Saturn visits your sign from May 24th to September 1st before returning for a longer stay starting in February 2026. It\u2019s a demanding transit, but through its influence, you learn to count on yourself. Of course, your relationship with yourself affects all life \u201cdepartments\u201d in profound ways. The responsibilities you let slide in the past come up for close attention, and while it can sometimes feel like an onslaught, you are more than equipped to meet the challenges. Keep in mind that those things that you\u2019ve managed well in the past are now being rewarded. Saturn is karmic \u2013 you are experiencing what you are due at this point. It\u2019s a powerful time to get your life back on track. The process of getting closer to your true self will involve some restructuring of your attitudes toward professional goals and images. \n The year is strong for studies, writing, and other mental pursuits. More joy can be found in these pursuits, although you can have a tendency to take on more than you can manage at this time, so watch for this! \n More: \n 2025 Yearly Preview Horoscope  and the  Aries 2025  \n \n This Year in Love: Aries \n 2025 Love Horoscope for Aries \n There haven\u2019t been many direct long-term influences on your love life in recent years, dear Aries, but with a set of eclipses in your sign and partnership sector recently, some things have been brewing!

There's a strong focus on personality development, finances, family, domestic life, and talents. On many levels, you can feel revitalized. People notice you for who you are and not only for what you do. You\u2019re getting ahead because of your fabulous personality more than other assets in May. Home life becomes more animated, and family life demands more of your time. \n While Venus, your ruling planet, spends the entire month in your privacy sector, it\u2019s moving direct all month, and there is a sense of forward movement nonetheless. You\u2019re still in an incubation stage regarding your love life and affections \u2013 there are things to process and perhaps some healing to do before you\u2019re clear-headed with these things. However, if this was agonizing at times in April, it\u2019s a much smoother process in May. Venus will enter your sign in June, and you\u2019ll be raring to go, but for now, sorting things out will serve you well. In fact, you may need to deemphasize your love life to take advantage of other opportunities. \n You have much in the way of personal impact even though you're still keeping some things to yourself, as you should, and putting some decisions on hold. The month is a strong yet gentle one for you. You\u2019re in the driver\u2019s seat. Yes, this is true in a general sense, but with the Sun in your sign until the 20th, you\u2019re feeling super confident, and changes made now seem to have visible, quick results. \n Support is there if you need it, possibly from an unusual or hidden source, or your feelings emerge from deep within, guiding you. A surprise and strong attraction or interest can be brewing. There is a greater appreciation for the quiet, easygoing moments in your relationships. You might also experience a rush of confidence to take action on a personal matter or to put something behind you. \n From the 10th, you\u2019re speaking up more often and making executive decisions. However, partnership matters may reach a turning point around the 12th. You\u2019ll come into strong touch with your feelings related to a negotiation, commitment, or one-to-one relationship. A partner can have a surprising revelation. \n Pluto begins its yearly retrograde cycle this month, and some of your long-term career goals may be up for review until October. It's a time for reworking career and planning initiatives.\u00a0Facing up to truths about the past and a closer look at career, life path, and relationship matters can be part of the picture. You\u2019re more able to see areas where you\u2019ve been over-attached, overthinking, worried, or obsessed. \n The biggest area of passion and possible upheaval this month is likely to involve your private world, family life, and home matters.

Uranus begins its transition out of your sign, and Jupiter\u2019s influence brings more pleasure in what you have. Personal finances, communications, and learning are big themes in your life in 2025. \n It\u2019s not especially well-known about Taurus, but you take your social life to heart \u2013 your relationships not only with a close partner, but also with siblings, neighbors, and friends. 2025 is a year for enriching these relationships. With the North Node in your solar eleventh house most of the year, it\u2019s especially important for you to establish yourself as a team player. \n This period in your life is also a time for building a solid foundation. Finances are looking quite nice, as long as you are moderate with your spending. More day-to-day contact with friends and family, and even in-laws, can be healing and pleasurable. \n With Saturn and Neptune moving into your solar twelfth house this year and next, you\u2019ll be exploring matters of guilt or lack of closure that may affect you more than you know.

As such, in some ways, rebelliousness or instability is leaving your life. In other ways, career or life-path matters are a bit heavier on you in 2025. \n You want the freedom to express yourself, and you don\u2019t want to feel confined, with Uranus continuing its transit of your sign in 2025. This long-term influence is on its way out, but you won\u2019t say goodbye to it for good until April 2026. Independence tends to trump other drives in most areas of your life, including relationships. Relationships may be a little unstable as a result. \n Taurus is known for their rootedness and desire for peace and calm, so the electric Uranian energy in your life may throw a few people you know for a loop! Don\u2019t worry; the important people will adjust and accommodate your need for self-expression. Just try to avoid making unnecessary sweeping changes and discern between rebellious behavior and fair behavior. Make sure you\u2019re making choices on your own terms instead of only  reacting . \n Of course, Uranus has been in Taurus for many years now, and more people are used to this energy. In 2025, it\u2019s especially affecting those born late in the sign of Taurus or with a later Taurus Ascendant: May 14-20 and those with an Ascendant of approximately 23-30 degrees Taurus. \n Soon enough, you won\u2019t be answering to a rebellious muse, and Uranus won\u2019t be putting pressure on you to carve your own path. But this final leg of the Uranus-in-Taurus transit is an easier one as Uranus harmonizes with Saturn, the Moon\u2019s North Node, and Neptune, suggesting a more harmonious, prosperous period for your innovations\u2026 cont\u2019d \n More:  2025 Taurus Love Horoscope \n \u00a0 \n Here\u2019s to a fulfilling and successful day! \n Note:  Read the sections for both your Sun Sign and Ascendant for a better picture of what lies ahead for the day.

There's a strong focus on personality development, finances, family, domestic life, and talents. On many levels, you can feel revitalized. People notice you for who you are and not only for what you do. You\u2019re getting ahead because of your fabulous personality more than other assets in May. Home life becomes more animated, and family life demands more of your time. \n While Venus, your ruling planet, spends the entire month in your privacy sector, it\u2019s moving direct all month, and there is a sense of forward movement nonetheless. You\u2019re still in an incubation stage regarding your love life and affections \u2013 there are things to process and perhaps some healing to do before you\u2019re clear-headed with these things. However, if this was agonizing at times in April, it\u2019s a much smoother process in May. Venus will enter your sign in June, and you\u2019ll be raring to go, but for now, sorting things out will serve you well. In fact, you may need to deemphasize your love life to take advantage of other opportunities. \n You have much in the way of personal impact even though you're still keeping some things to yourself, as you should, and putting some decisions on hold. The month is a strong yet gentle one for you. You\u2019re in the driver\u2019s seat. Yes, this is true in a general sense, but with the Sun in your sign until the 20th, you\u2019re feeling super confident, and changes made now seem to have visible, quick results. \n Support is there if you need it, possibly from an unusual or hidden source, or your feelings emerge from deep within, guiding you. A surprise and strong attraction or interest can be brewing. There is a greater appreciation for the quiet, easygoing moments in your relationships. You might also experience a rush of confidence to take action on a personal matter or to put something behind you. \n From the 10th, you\u2019re speaking up more often and making executive decisions. However, partnership matters may reach a turning point around the 12th. You\u2019ll come into strong touch with your feelings related to a negotiation, commitment, or one-to-one relationship. A partner can have a surprising revelation. \n Pluto begins its yearly retrograde cycle this month, and some of your long-term career goals may be up for review until October. It's a time for reworking career and planning initiatives.\u00a0Facing up to truths about the past and a closer look at career, life path, and relationship matters can be part of the picture. You\u2019re more able to see areas where you\u2019ve been over-attached, overthinking, worried, or obsessed. \n The biggest area of passion and possible upheaval this month is likely to involve your private world, family life, and home matters. You\u2019re ambitious about these things now, desiring to make deep changes that will last. There can also be bigger emotions felt at home than elsewhere \u2013 tempers may be prominent. The trick is to avoid impatience and impulsiveness. Strategize for best results. You may want to rule the roost now, and this can be successful as long as you\u2019re a gentle leader!

You're tweaking your manner and image to suit the \"you\" you've become. The Sun is in your sign, and you're in a new solar cycle. This is a time for shining! While there may be some things you\u2019re putting behind you, you\u2019re looking forward now. You\u2019re more noticeable and even more magnetic than usual. \n This year, the New Moon on May 26th was particularly supportive of your ability to express yourself and appeal to your \u201caudience.\u201d This theme sticks with you until the New Moon this month (on June 25th). You're reinventing yourself! It's a time of year for developing the self. Certainly, you have significant powers of communication on your side in June. \n The first three weeks of the month bring you much attention, after which things feel more predictable and steady. Your head and heart may not always be on the same page this month, as your heart remains attuned to the past and possibly needs extra care and time. You continue to meet your daily responsibilities with gusto, although when the pace of your life slows from the 20th forward, you welcome it. \n From the 6th forward, love matters and certain projects may require mulling. You're seeking pleasure in quiet time, private moments, and perhaps even the past as you explore your feelings on the down-low. Venus will enter your sign on July 4th, and emotions and pleasures will clarify or simplify. For now, you\u2019re dealing with many different layers of your affections, and it\u2019s a good time to process and digest recent events slowly and carefully. Even so, watch for a tendency to attract situations that work against you or are so complicated that they leave you drained and exhausted. Someone may be trying to take advantage of a vulnerability or your tendency to feel guilty, for example. During busy times, aim to draw boundaries with your energy and time. This is a period for \"allowing\" others to appreciate you - in other words, accepting their attention - even if you feel much more comfortable playing a supportive role. \n Mercury continues to excite you mentally until the 8th, after which you\u2019re less concerned about innovations and more focused on your practical affairs. Mercury\u2019s transit of your sign boosts your desire to express yourself until the 8th, and Mars in your communications sector to the 17th reinforces this further, adding a layer of courage, although sometimes impatience as well. The first half of June is powerful for both asserting and expressing yourself, although there can be times when you\u2019re a bit tense or wired. \n You can feel excited to share more by talking, writing, and connecting with others. You communicate persuasively, and others see you as especially wise. Opportunities to expand your mind, learn something valuable, or resolve a conflict may present themselves. \n The Full Moon on the 11th is powerful for attending to close relationships. A matter brewing, buried, or hidden reaches a head, and there can be discoveries or epiphanies about your feelings or a close relationship. There could be new clients, invitations, sudden interest in your services or, more simply, your companionship. \n Old baggage arrives with Mars moving into your solar fourth house from the 17th forward, but the good news is that you have all of the energy and gumption to deal with it hands-on rather than passively allowing it to drive your behavior. Family life is active and possibly demanding. \n The second half of the month plays a little more to your practical side. Money matters assume particular importance to you. Home and family life can be busy, animated, and energetic. Conflicts may emerge, but treat them as the chance to take care of problems once and for all. Mars heats up your personal life and domestic world. While exciting for getting things done around the home, you can sometimes feel that your desires are working against you or that you\u2019re at odds with others during this cycle. You can make this transit work for you with some creativity, however. The trick is to pour excess energy into constructive projects and take a good look at how you\u2019re expressing (or bottling) anger. Increased self-awareness can lead to solutions and improvements. \n Saturn entered Aries on May 24th, moving out of your career sector and into the sector of your solar chart that rules friendships, networking, and dreams/wishes. During this cycle that runs for much of the coming three years, there can be some heaviness or selectiveness in your dealings with friends and perhaps more burdens, limitations, and responsibilities. However, it can also be a time when a friendship deepens and stabilizes. You can set solid, meaningful, long-term plans into motion. You\u2019ll find that your goals are shifting, and you are ready to take on challenges. You can accomplish a great deal with minimal stress. With Saturn in a supportive aspect to your sign, you might enjoy a more stable and steady period. \n Interestingly, Jupiter exits your sign this month--a month primarily devoted to you. This Jupiter transit has been with you for just over a year, boosting your confidence and independence. With Jupiter\u2019s new transit, starting on June 9th and sticking with you until June 30th, 2026, you\u2019ll build upon exciting ideas and prospects you picked up during the lucky planet\u2019s journey through your sign. It\u2019s time to secure your place in the world with a quieter, comfier transit, which may be just what you need now! This transit is filled with potential for growth and security. \n A windfall or significant gift can be in focus. You\u2019re pouring more heart, energy, and perhaps money into your comfort and security. It\u2019s an excellent time to build something solid for yourself, especially a business, but this can extend to a relationship, home, hobby, or more. \n The desire to expand, grow, or enjoy your money and things can sometimes clash with your social pursuits this month, however. For example, there can be drains on your resources from friends or from experimenting with new ventures. Instead, the desire to nest, get comfortable, and enjoy more steadiness in your life can clash with responsibilities to friends or groups at this time. \n The Sun heads out of your sign on the 20th, officially pulling you into the introspective phase that has been coming on gradually. You\u2019re likely to delight in taking some extra time for yourself. Finances are looking up. You conduct yourself with more self-respect in the business world and attract respect. This can be a good time for well-researched purchases, but impulse buys can be decent as well, as your intuition is quite good for money. The New Moon on the 25th heralds a new beginning with money and things. \n In the last ten days of the month, beautiful energy is with you for psychological or physical healing programs, financial initiatives, an awakening of inner life, and powerful intuition. You can rely wonderfully on your intuition now, and business pays off. Investing in or putting money into improvements to the home can be in order. Family businesses can thrive now. \n May 2025 Monthly Horoscope Overview for Gemini: \n The first three weeks of May are often a time to tie up loose ends and live life under the radar for you, dear Gemini. It's the case this year in some ways, but you\u2019re also living quite spiritedly! Mercury, your ruler, is moving quickly, and you've caught up to speed. Both Venus and Mars are moving in harmony with your sign, bolstering your energy and charm and endowing you with further power to assert yourself and the courage to pursue your desires. \n Routes to satisfaction are becoming clearer. While April had its fair share of roadblocks, May feels more energizing and supportive overall. People, more often than not, respond positively to you, and support from friends, associates, groups, or even your community can be forthcoming. The month is particularly supportive of your efforts to connect harmoniously with others. \n Energy is generally good this month, even if it's sometimes directed to your private life or the background. May is a month for dusting off ideas you\u2019ve previously put on the shelf. People are paying more attention. There can be a lot of your energy focused on helping or supporting others this month, and you might often find yourself in a position of go-between or mediator. You can be especially intuitive and sometimes quite distracted and preoccupied this month. \n You\u2019re mentally wired, and you want to put ideas into action this month. You might feel impatient with idle chatter or with others\u2019 slower pace or minds, making it imperative that you find ways to move at your own pace or work independently. There can be a significant intellectual competition in May. \n The Full Moon on the 12th is eye-opening and warm. This is a time ripe for discovery, surprise, and blooming, especially related to intimacy, work, and health. These are areas of your life that can reach a turning point. The focus should be on both physical and mental health, which becomes especially obvious if you\u2019ve prioritized one over the other. If your daily affairs have become difficult to manage, for example, you'll get a kick in the pants to get things under control. \n Relationships with friends and associates improve considerably in May. If you\u2019ve been out of touch or dealing with confusing situations, you\u2019ll find that these issues clear up this month. People are warmer and more inclined to reach out. As well, you're more receptive. \n While you\u2019re in your yearly period of repose and winding down, it can be a big idea month, and it\u2019s quite excellent for reaching out to others, although part of you wants nothing more than to withdraw and replenish your energy! Dealing with errands and short trips may be frequent, and a balance should be sought. \n With the Sun\u2019s position in your privacy sector to the 20th and Mars in your communications sector all month, you may be giving off a \u201cleave me alone\u201d energy. However, Venus helps smooth over your relations with special friends and groups. \n In fact, you're connecting with your dreams, desire to participate, and happiness goals, and it\u2019s extremely rewarding\u2013even healing. As you humble yourself to your need for community or contributing, you feel good about yourself, freer, happier, and more personally confident. \n From May 4th forward, you may find yourself reassessing, observing, and gaining a new vision of a publishing project, educational path, or belief system. \n It\u2019s an excellent time to make mental and social connections. Your communications, teachings, studies, ideas, and writing may be a little hasty at times, and there can be times when you feel mentally wired. However, you enjoy greater passion and motivation to get things done and to learn or produce. You may not often sit still, and you\u2019re inclined to want to initiate independent work and projects. You learn best when you are teaching yourself or engaged in self-study right now. \n The Sun is in your sign from the 20th forward, launching your month-long personal power period. This transit brings you into the personal spotlight. The New Moon on the 26th kickstarts new beginnings. It\u2019s a time when you\u2019re coming out of your shell, connecting with others more often, and stirring things up. \n The last week of the month is strong for resolving problems, getting back into the swing of things, developing new or picking up old interests, studies, or other \u201cbusy work,\u201d and a stronger feeling that you\u2019re on track. Verbalizing your desires can be in sharp focus. You can feel driven to express yourself or communicate with someone. Others hear you or turn to you for your input. It\u2019s a week of meaningful realizations, epiphanies, and clarifications. \n More:  Monthly Horoscopes \u2013 Details \n \n This Year: Gemini \n 2025  Overview \n It\u2019s an exciting year for you, dear Gemini. You have expansive Jupiter in your sign until June, and Uranus moves into Gemini in July. It\u2019s a year for exploring your needs and pursuing your dreams. Your personality, image, body image, and self-confidence expand to new levels, and you see whole new possibilities. Your vision of life is panoramic. \n It\u2019s a time for different experiences, adventures, or learning journeys, although there can be some moments of discontent or restlessness. The year finds you most bold and intriguing. Partnership, publishing, or adventurous opportunities might come knocking at your door. \n Promising developments are also likely with finances in 2025. You feel you\u2019re moving forward and growing, craving freedom and independence, and perhaps facing some endings in the process. \n As you\u2019re freer to be yourself, many accept you more readily. Still, subtle yet profound changes within you affect your relationships with others and how you present yourself. Your integrity strengthens. \n Stirrings and changes in career goals, professional interests, or social standing could be catalysts for this growth process.

Many Geminis will be starting or building businesses this year that will benefit them for years to come. This will not come without hard work and persistence, but you are likely to enjoy the process more if you work on those things that really matter in the long term. \n You\u2019re often feeling more powerful, persuasive, and connected with your beliefs and principles in 2025. \n Uranus awakens your consciousness to areas of your life where you felt restricted. Events now and in upcoming years might free you from confining situations or conditioning patterns. You\u2019re gaining inspiration. A new person, influence, or path can bring changes.

The Leo Moon is bold, creative, and competitive. \n However, Mercury forms a minor square with Chiron today, pointing to some hesitation in making decisions. \n This transit challenges us to communicate with more sensitivity. \n With Jupiter's biquintile with Pluto, we are deeply interested in \u2014 and skilled at \u2014 strategy for achieving our goals. \n It\u2019s a time of easily sniffing out opportunities.

You're tweaking your manner and image to suit the \"you\" you've become. The Sun is in your sign, and you're in a new solar cycle. This is a time for shining! While there may be some things you\u2019re putting behind you, you\u2019re looking forward now. You\u2019re more noticeable and even more magnetic than usual. \n This year, the New Moon on May 26th was particularly supportive of your ability to express yourself and appeal to your \u201caudience.\u201d This theme sticks with you until the New Moon this month (on June 25th). You're reinventing yourself! It's a time of year for developing the self. Certainly, you have significant powers of communication on your side in June. \n The first three weeks of the month bring you much attention, after which things feel more predictable and steady. Your head and heart may not always be on the same page this month, as your heart remains attuned to the past and possibly needs extra care and time. You continue to meet your daily responsibilities with gusto, although when the pace of your life slows from the 20th forward, you welcome it. \n From the 6th forward, love matters and certain projects may require mulling. You're seeking pleasure in quiet time, private moments, and perhaps even the past as you explore your feelings on the down-low. Venus will enter your sign on July 4th, and emotions and pleasures will clarify or simplify. For now, you\u2019re dealing with many different layers of your affections, and it\u2019s a good time to process and digest recent events slowly and carefully. Even so, watch for a tendency to attract situations that work against you or are so complicated that they leave you drained and exhausted. Someone may be trying to take advantage of a vulnerability or your tendency to feel guilty, for example. During busy times, aim to draw boundaries with your energy and time. This is a period for \"allowing\" others to appreciate you - in other words, accepting their attention - even if you feel much more comfortable playing a supportive role. \n Mercury continues to excite you mentally until the 8th, after which you\u2019re less concerned about innovations and more focused on your practical affairs. Mercury\u2019s transit of your sign boosts your desire to express yourself until the 8th, and Mars in your communications sector to the 17th reinforces this further, adding a layer of courage, although sometimes impatience as well. The first half of June is powerful for both asserting and expressing yourself, although there can be times when you\u2019re a bit tense or wired. \n You can feel excited to share more by talking, writing, and connecting with others. You communicate persuasively, and others see you as especially wise. Opportunities to expand your mind, learn something valuable, or resolve a conflict may present themselves. \n The Full Moon on the 11th is powerful for attending to close relationships. A matter brewing, buried, or hidden reaches a head, and there can be discoveries or epiphanies about your feelings or a close relationship. There could be new clients, invitations, sudden interest in your services or, more simply, your companionship. \n Old baggage arrives with Mars moving into your solar fourth house from the 17th forward, but the good news is that you have all of the energy and gumption to deal with it hands-on rather than passively allowing it to drive your behavior. Family life is active and possibly demanding. \n The second half of the month plays a little more to your practical side. Money matters assume particular importance to you. Home and family life can be busy, animated, and energetic. Conflicts may emerge, but treat them as the chance to take care of problems once and for all. Mars heats up your personal life and domestic world. While exciting for getting things done around the home, you can sometimes feel that your desires are working against you or that you\u2019re at odds with others during this cycle. You can make this transit work for you with some creativity, however. The trick is to pour excess energy into constructive projects and take a good look at how you\u2019re expressing (or bottling) anger. Increased self-awareness can lead to solutions and improvements. \n Saturn entered Aries on May 24th, moving out of your career sector and into the sector of your solar chart that rules friendships, networking, and dreams/wishes. During this cycle that runs for much of the coming three years, there can be some heaviness or selectiveness in your dealings with friends and perhaps more burdens, limitations, and responsibilities. However, it can also be a time when a friendship deepens and stabilizes. You can set solid, meaningful, long-term plans into motion. You\u2019ll find that your goals are shifting, and you are ready to take on challenges. You can accomplish a great deal with minimal stress. With Saturn in a supportive aspect to your sign, you might enjoy a more stable and steady period. \n Interestingly, Jupiter exits your sign this month--a month primarily devoted to you. This Jupiter transit has been with you for just over a year, boosting your confidence and independence. With Jupiter\u2019s new transit, starting on June 9th and sticking with you until June 30th, 2026, you\u2019ll build upon exciting ideas and prospects you picked up during the lucky planet\u2019s journey through your sign. It\u2019s time to secure your place in the world with a quieter, comfier transit, which may be just what you need now! This transit is filled with potential for growth and security. \n A windfall or significant gift can be in focus. You\u2019re pouring more heart, energy, and perhaps money into your comfort and security. It\u2019s an excellent time to build something solid for yourself, especially a business, but this can extend to a relationship, home, hobby, or more. \n The desire to expand, grow, or enjoy your money and things can sometimes clash with your social pursuits this month, however. For example, there can be drains on your resources from friends or from experimenting with new ventures. Instead, the desire to nest, get comfortable, and enjoy more steadiness in your life can clash with responsibilities to friends or groups at this time. \n The Sun heads out of your sign on the 20th, officially pulling you into the introspective phase that has been coming on gradually. You\u2019re likely to delight in taking some extra time for yourself. Finances are looking up. You conduct yourself with more self-respect in the business world and attract respect. This can be a good time for well-researched purchases, but impulse buys can be decent as well, as your intuition is quite good for money. The New Moon on the 25th heralds a new beginning with money and things. \n In the last ten days of the month, beautiful energy is with you for psychological or physical healing programs, financial initiatives, an awakening of inner life, and powerful intuition. You can rely wonderfully on your intuition now, and business pays off. Investing in or putting money into improvements to the home can be in order. Family businesses can thrive now. \n May 2025 Monthly Horoscope Overview for Gemini: \n The first three weeks of May are often a time to tie up loose ends and live life under the radar for you, dear Gemini. It's the case this year in some ways, but you\u2019re also living quite spiritedly! Mercury, your ruler, is moving quickly, and you've caught up to speed. Both Venus and Mars are moving in harmony with your sign, bolstering your energy and charm and endowing you with further power to assert yourself and the courage to pursue your desires. \n Routes to satisfaction are becoming clearer. While April had its fair share of roadblocks, May feels more energizing and supportive overall. People, more often than not, respond positively to you, and support from friends, associates, groups, or even your community can be forthcoming. The month is particularly supportive of your efforts to connect harmoniously with others. \n Energy is generally good this month, even if it's sometimes directed to your private life or the background. May is a month for dusting off ideas you\u2019ve previously put on the shelf. People are paying more attention. There can be a lot of your energy focused on helping or supporting others this month, and you might often find yourself in a position of go-between or mediator. You can be especially intuitive and sometimes quite distracted and preoccupied this month. \n You\u2019re mentally wired, and you want to put ideas into action this month. You might feel impatient with idle chatter or with others\u2019 slower pace or minds, making it imperative that you find ways to move at your own pace or work independently. There can be a significant intellectual competition in May. \n The Full Moon on the 12th is eye-opening and warm. This is a time ripe for discovery, surprise, and blooming, especially related to intimacy, work, and health. These are areas of your life that can reach a turning point. The focus should be on both physical and mental health, which becomes especially obvious if you\u2019ve prioritized one over the other. If your daily affairs have become difficult to manage, for example, you'll get a kick in the pants to get things under control. \n Relationships with friends and associates improve considerably in May. If you\u2019ve been out of touch or dealing with confusing situations, you\u2019ll find that these issues clear up this month. People are warmer and more inclined to reach out. As well, you're more receptive. \n While you\u2019re in your yearly period of repose and winding down, it can be a big idea month, and it\u2019s quite excellent for reaching out to others, although part of you wants nothing more than to withdraw and replenish your energy!

The month has a feel-good vibe but also holds the potential for making profound changes and improvements. \n Friends can be wonderfully helpful, and your social life or happiness pursuits can offer up pleasant distractions and encouragement. You're making new connections or cementing existing ones. Friends need attention but are supportive. You're coming up with exciting long-term plans or ideas. There can be opportunities to learn, share, and enjoy friendships, or you can feel more optimistic about your connections. Thinking in big, broad terms can help you develop innovative new ideas and plans. It can be an excellent time to make pacts or agreements. \n Your diplomatic qualities are highlighted from the 6th forward with Venus in your solar tenth house. Finding a balance between your personal and professional life is necessary for optimal success. While this transit isn't remarkable for your personal life, it doesn\u2019t seem to harm it, either.

Venus here can be excellent for your reputation and career and strong for business relationships. \n The Full Moon on the 11th brings a nice change in a creative or romantic pursuit. It's a great time for a sudden epiphany or idea that can have long-term benefits. This Full Moon brings feelings to light quite dramatically. It's a playful, expressive, and creative time. Romantic relationships get a boost. \n The first half of June is high energy, with you in charge and in the lead. The pace can be wild at times. As the month moves forward, it becomes wiser to conserve your energy. From the 20th, you are feeling strong, but don't jump into action just yet - take the leap in your imagination first and see how it feels before taking a big step. Practical and business matters thrive. \n Mercury transits your privacy sector from the 8th to 26th, however, and you\u2019re a little more insular or observant on a mental level during this cycle. You tend to adapt to stressors through further contemplation or escaping into your own world. It's a time for giving your life some thought rather than diving right in, which is your usual style! Once Mars leaves your sign on the 17th, you'll find this more straightforward. \n For much longer than usual, Mars has been animating your sign, and on June 17th, it moves into your resources sector. Mars will be here, heating up your drive to handle, accumulate, and manage your money and personal possessions until early August. The desire to take charge of your income and to be self-reliant dominates. You are making the connection between money and freedom. Personal pressures are lifting, and you are feeling stronger, more in control, and more mature as well. The way to your heart now is a practical route; you're more interested in reliability and security than you are in flowery attention. \n Saturn recently moved into your spirit sector and will visit it for much of the coming three years. Its first round has already begun and runs until September 1st. Part Two will span from February 2026 to April 2028. This transit can bring more focus on teaching, publishing, and sharing information in your career or in preparation for it. It\u2019s also a stabilizing, supportive energy that helps you meet your responsibilities. Getting organized becomes a priority, and it's easier than usual! Saturn moving in harmony with your sign may not be the most glamorous of transits, but it does help round out your life. \n Jupiter slips into your privacy sector this month, where it will spend just over a year, and this can lead to a stronger sense of spiritual peace, a deep inner calm, preparing you internally for outward changes when Jupiter passes over your Sun starting in June 2026. This transit can bring some magic to your inner world, along with the ability to take things in stride. Even though you may be working behind the scenes or a little more withdrawn than usual in the year ahead, this transit helps you to find comfort in a little more introspection and solitude. Still, it\u2019s seldom a lonely sort of self-absorption. Self-contentment is a more apt word to describe it. If you need help during this Jupiter transit, it tends to come just in the nick of time from unanticipated or hidden sources. \n You will be building tremendous inner and spiritual strength in the year ahead, and it all begins now! It\u2019s an excellent period for giving of yourself on a charitable level, as you will derive much satisfaction from doing so. You may find that a partner\u2019s daily life or health improves nicely during this period. Fears and anxieties that may have weighed you down with guilt or pressure can easily be faced and lifted this year. \n You\u2019re in great shape for enjoying your own company, gaining more peace and quiet, trusting your intuition, and supporting others or doing behind-the-scenes good deeds. \n Still, if you\u2019ve lined up too many potential projects or if you\u2019re faced with too many choices, you could reach a point of feeling overwhelmed at times this month. While you have a great need and desire to enjoy more downtime, privacy, and rest or detox, outside obligations, such as courses or special goals, can be calling you, and you may feel limited until you find workarounds and a compromise. \n From the 20th forward, you begin the wind-down period of your solar year. You require some extra time alone to sort out your plans, to recharge your energy and motivation levels, and to avoid overload. Generally speaking, it\u2019s not the best time to get started on a significant project or new initiative unless it\u2019s about doing preparatory work for said endeavor. Your extra sensitivity now can sometimes seem to work against you at this time of year, but it can help you see yourself a little more clearly since, much of the time, you can be working on autopilot and possibly ignoring some important emotional or spiritual needs in the process. Now is the time of the year to get in touch, and it\u2019s enlightening! \n The New Moon on the 25th brings take-charge energy for making time for yourself, introspection, and attention to your inner world. You may need more time to process recent events and feelings. This New Moon brings your strong attention to rest, repose, and healing, launching an important period of looking for answers within. \n This doesn\u2019t mean you have to while away your time or sit on your hands. In fact, with the Sun and Jupiter connecting around the time of this New Moon and painting the energies of the last week of June warm colors, you\u2019re inclined to enjoy yourself fully, even if this is mostly happening behind the scenes. Plus, Mercury enters your sign on the 26th, and you're mentally busy and positive, entering a new phase and enjoying your fresh start. \n Leo \n May 2025 Monthly Horoscope Overview for Leo: \n The month ahead particularly supports broadening your horizons and branching out, dear Leo, perhaps through an expansion of your audience, adventure, or studies. A personal philosophy or belief system comes into stronger focus and more clarity. Where April was bumpy, blocks clear in May. \n You\u2019re also in a fine position to take charge of your work, manage others, take the lead, and make great strides towards your larger goals in May. You\u2019re willing to put in the legwork and just the right amount of extra effort to shine--or outshine. \n You can be quite headstrong and independent in May. While you have a strong sense of the rules, the enterprising side of your nature emerges powerfully this month, and you could find yourself challenging traditions. \n You\u2019re taking a well-rounded approach to life this month, which may be the key to your overall success. Activities with others keep you busy and motivated. Learning with study groups can be beneficial, or you might acquire new knowledge or gain inspiration from groups you connect with now. It's a powerful time to learn, guide, share, and connect--and to heal through these experiences. \n Pluto's retrograde cycle from the 4th forward (until October) holds the potential for new discoveries and insights. It's a time to reassess one-on-one relationships and living conditions. You might review your feelings or examine whether you've been clinging to old patterns instead of braving new territory. The process of gaining more objectivity will help you identify areas where you\u2019ve pushed too hard or where you\u2019ve been too attached for your own good! \n While you are likely to be doing a good job of balancing your personal and professional lives, if these areas are out of whack, the Full Moon on the 12th will point you in the right direction, whether this is via an event or personal epiphany. Home and family matters assume larger importance, and you might discover or connect with strong feelings about your living arrangements or family situation. This can be a wonderful time for reaching out to or spending extra time with family. It can also be a time for significant memories that help you make decisions in the present. \n Mars is energizing your sign all month. There can be times when you clash with others, or circumstances seem to be resisting you, but overall, you\u2019re raring to go, ready to take action. Lively energy is with you! This Mars transit is energizing \u2013 you\u2019re ready to take on a challenge, and you\u2019re interested in innovating, being the first, and getting ahead. Venus in a compatible sign attracts rather than pursues, so you have both yin and yang energies going for you now. \n Some friendly competition can help inspire happy improvements. Business connected with art, music, and other creative ventures can prosper, or there can be the right timing with money and business. Mutually beneficial agreements, romance, increased confidence, and broadening your mind are in favor. Romantic possibilities are with you, possibly with someone with a very different background. \n With Mars in Leo this month, you can be impatient with too much talk or long-drawn-out explanations. As long as you are determined to make the most of this period, it\u2019s a great time for standing up for yourself and for new initiatives that require action and courage more than plans and deliberation. You can\u2019t force confidence \u2013 confidence builds as self-mastery skills increase. This is why truly confident moves have wonderful results now, and rash or pushy moves seem to have consequences. \n The Sun moves into your friendship sector on the 20th, spotlighting your social life and happiness goals. There can be the chance to start fresh on a social level after the New Moon on the 26th. The last week of the month particularly supports new interests and friendships or a new lease on an old friendship. Your enthusiasm wins others over, and your unique qualities and perspective give your personality extra sparkle. \n Transits help clarify a matter about a friendship or a special project. You can be filled with excitement and anticipation about emerging new ideas for long-term plans and projects. Developing a friendly rapport with someone can be highly motivating. You\u2019re independent this month, but you are wise enough to value the group and cherished friends\u2019 input. Diplomacy has its distinct benefits. \n More:  Monthly Horoscopes \u2013 Details \n \n This Year: Leo \n 2025  Overview \n Until June, and especially from February forward, it\u2019s a time for making connections and inspiring new ideas, dear Leo. Your social circle is expanding, although you should watch for excesses. While the saying goes that you can never have too many friends, you don\u2019t want to spread yourself thin. Similarly, avoid beginning so many new projects that you scatter yourself across them. \n However, friends or groups can be supportive, and, for some Leos, romance ties in with friendship or group associations. Your team spirit runs high, and you might make wonderful contributions to a group or with associates you can feel proud of. \n You might consider Jupiter\u2019s entry into the sign behind yours in June as the opportunity for a retreat of sorts \u2013 a year-long cycle that prepares you for Jupiter\u2019s transit of Leo that will begin in July 2026. You come into closer touch with your emotional renewal needs now. It\u2019s probably best to defer the bigger choices and decisions to a later date. While there can be times that you feel in limbo, you can take full advantage of this period for extra rest and introspection. Love becomes private somehow, or you find joy in different pleasures and pastimes. You might be keeping quiet about a relationship or your feelings. \n With Uranus on its way out of your career and reputation sector, you\u2019ll enjoy this planet\u2019s lessons as well as look forward to more stability with these life departments. Discovering your true calling comes more organically now. Friendships will be going through some changes, offering the potential for new connections and alliances. Similarly, partnerships also transform this year and in upcoming years, presenting opportunities for new and exciting collaborations. Someone you didn\u2019t like in the past can become an ally, showing the potential for transformation in relationships. Resolutions of a long-standing problem in a relationship can figure strongly, bringing a sense of not only closure but also personal growth. \n Attention to your daily affairs in recent years has sometimes been limiting, but you\u2019re coming out of that phase, freeing you up for more interesting and even frivolous experiences from time to time. Still, developing more order or discipline with your outside interests, education, or sharing can be a rewarding path. \n More:  Leo 2025  \n More:  2025 Yearly  \n \u00a0 \n This Year in Love: Leo \n \u00a0 \n 2025 Love Horoscope for Leo \n There are key changes in your solar chart in 2025 that suggest new attitudes and needs concerning committed partnerships, dear Leo, with Pluto now fully transitioned into the role of long-term guest in your partnership sector. \n Uranus rules your solar chart\u2019s partnership sector, and it\u2019s in Taurus and your career/reputation sector again this year, but only part-time.

            "summary": "Virgo Daily Horoscope \n Today's Virgo  \n May 30, 2025 \n The Moon leaves your social sector today and settles into your privacy sector for a couple of days, dear Virgo. This is a signal from the cosmos to take things easy--or easier--so that you can catch your breath and process recent events and feelings. The Moon's flowing aspect to Saturn today can help you understand which attitudes and situations are no longer working for you. Saturn recently began its longer-term transit of your solar eighth house. The first leg of the transit runs until September 1st, and the final leg will happen from February 2026 to April 2028. During this cycle, you may be dealing with some restricted support or resources from a partner. If there is some dullness or routine involved in your intimate life, you\u2019ll want to do something about it. It's also a time for learning to rely more faithfully on your ability to make a living. You would do well to organize your finances and get a stronger sense of where you stand in terms of indebtedness and support, as circumstances are such that you are ready to tidy up in these areas in the next while.

The Leo Moon is bold, creative, and competitive. \n However, Mercury forms a minor square with Chiron today, pointing to some hesitation in making decisions. \n This transit challenges us to communicate with more sensitivity. \n With Jupiter's biquintile with Pluto, we are deeply interested in \u2014 and skilled at \u2014 strategy for achieving our goals. \n It\u2019s a time of easily sniffing out opportunities. We can feel more in control of our creative powers or more aware of our deeper ambitions, and it's a constructive and empowering state of mind. \n We\u2019re ready and willing to challenge ourselves and move just a little out of our comfort zones to achieve something important to us. \n The Moon is void from 12:51 PM EDT, with the Moon's last aspect before changing signs (a sextile to Uranus), until the Moon enters Leo at 4:17 PM EDT. \n \n This Week in Astrology \n \u00a0 \n More Daily Horoscopes \u2013 All Zodiac Signs: \n Select a Sign Aries Taurus Gemini Cancer Leo Virgo Libra Scorpio Sagittarius Capricorn Aquarius Pisces \n \u00a0 \n Featured at Cafe Astrology: \n Click for Yearly Forecast Specials \n This Month: Virgo \n June 2025 Monthly Horoscope Overview for Virgo: \n June is strong for attention to your long-term goals, reputation, career, and responsibilities, dear Virgo. It\u2019s a time to reach for new or redefined goals related to your life path. You are motivated to do your best or take the lead. \n Still, in the first half of the month, while there can be a flurry of activity, you don't necessarily have the personal energy to match, that is until Mars enters your sign on the 17th. You're more liable to make errors until then, but only if you are not listening to your body's signals to slow down. For the best results, do your best to keep up with opportunities, but don't push yourself to inhuman levels. Take the rest you need and pace yourself. \n Love is adventurous or spirited, and opportunities for financial gain often arise through a partner or the management of others' resources in June. Educational opportunities can open up from the 6th forward. Publishing or promotion can be in focus, and communications thrive. It's a time for feeling inspired, whether it\u2019s about your relationships, outlook, personal interests, or pleasing pastimes \u2014 or any combination of these! Aim high now, but not so high that you don\u2019t know where to begin. Your sign is all for reasonable and practical goals, so you shouldn\u2019t have too many problems with this. These themes are due to Venus in your solar ninth house--a supportive transit that gently encourages you and helps boost your popularity. \n It\u2019s also a time to see solutions to problems related to career or life path goals. You're hungry to learn new things and come to conclusions and resolutions! Transits facilitate conversations with people who can help you achieve your goals. It\u2019s a great time for optimism and hope or supportive news that excites you about your future. Who you know may be important now, but your positivity and confidence are key. \n The Full Moon on the 11th opens your eyes to a home or family matter. You may have been feeling stuck or in limbo, which can lead to an epiphany about your domestic world or the need for nurture, comfort, and safety. \n Mercury transits your social sector from the 8th to the 26th, increasing your attention to happiness goals, friendships, community involvement, and social activities. You could find yourself taking an interest in something entirely new now. The goals are to feel connected and contributing. \n Still, energy has been low recently with an extended stay of Mars in your privacy sector. As such, you may have had a hard time knowing how or where to focus your attention. However, with Mars entering your sign on the 17th, clarity comes. You are in take-charge mode, ready to take on a challenge, and willing to put yourself out to get where you want to go. This is also a powerful time for attracting romantic attention. \n Mars moving into your sign can feel like a nice rush, although it can overstimulate you at times, particularly if you don\u2019t have a goal to work toward. Still, it's a solid period for pursuing your plans and dreams and reanimating! You can be excited about your projects and personal interests. It\u2019s a time for taking the initiative, but do watch for oversized tempers. When you properly channel your energy during this transit, you are highly dynamic and creative. Even though your independence is in strong force, you\u2019re also in touch with others, especially once the Sun enters your social sector on the 20th. \n Saturn recently moved into your solar eighth house, where it will transit until September 1st. There will be a lengthy Part Two of this Saturn transit occurring from February 2026 to April 2028. During this cycle, if there's been dullness or routine in your intimate life, you'll want to do something about it. You may be dealing with some restricted support or resources from a partner, or there's more responsibility with your resources or in a relationship. This is a time for learning to rely more faithfully on your ability to make a living. You would do well to organize your finances and get a stronger sense of where you stand in terms of indebtedness and support, as circumstances are such that you want to tidy up in these areas. \n Another big planetary shift occurs from June 9th forward, and it lasts for over a year: Jupiter heads into your social sector. Social activity increases, or you\u2019re more interested in connecting with friends, networks, the community, or your higher goals, dreams, and plans. In the year ahead, you\u2019ll meet people and enjoy valuable connections during Jupiter\u2019s travels here. You\u2019re pinning your hopes on beautiful things, making mutually beneficial connections, and dreaming and planning for the future. You may meet acquaintances who help you further your goals, or you could join a new group or association that gives you considerable pleasure and satisfaction. \n At times this month, intimate relationships or an increased need for privacy or exclusiveness can impact friendships and social goals\u2013and vice versa! There can be challenges, such as power struggles or concerns about betrayal or boundaries. The desire to enjoy friendships and sharing is strong, but something or someone may hold you back or temporarily stand in your way. The key now is to look for ways to simplify your life, remembering that quality is more important than quantity in these areas. By simplifying your life, you can regain a sense of control. \n The last part of the month brings a surge in energy and initiative, which will carry over into July. You feel more than confident and happy to take the lead. While you\u2019re willing to move past obstacles now, there are fewer of them to deal with! Be as open, willing, positive, and faithful as feels comfortable. Something might inspire you to move forward on a personal goal, dream, or plan after the New Moon on the 25th. You suddenly see things as doable. There is some inclination to impulsiveness now with Mars in your sign, but if you are listening to gut instincts rather than simply reacting to people around you, then you\u2019re in good form. \n May 2025 Monthly Horoscope Overview for Virgo: \n There is a strong focus on adventure, spirit, and mind expansion this month, dear Virgo, but much is going on under the hood in May, especially with your intimate life and/or with money matters and support. Where there was some waiting, delays, and backtracking with these issues in April, doors are opening to you in May. The chances of smoothing over a disagreement or attracting the support you need are high. \n Your larger focus seems to be on the \u201cbig picture\u201d this month. You\u2019re seeking to stretch your mind. You see your heart more clearly, which also helps decision-making. Positive shifts can happen as you embrace exploring new subjects and places. Extra rest is crucial this month, but refreshing activities are essential, too. \n Pluto begins its yearly retrograde cycle on May 4th, and problem areas can magnify with the shift, likely related to work, routines, communications, and health. As you grow accustomed to this energy, you\u2019re in a brilliant position to review and reassess these matters as you gain perspective. You might more clearly see where you\u2019ve been over-attached or where you\u2019ve put too much pressure on yourself along these lines. \n Doing out-of-the-ordinary things or changing routines up is attractive in May, but there is a considerable focus on healing, resting, and tying up loose ends as Mars transits the sign just behind yours all month. You're gaining the motivation and energy to handle a matter that has been on your mind for some time. Otherwise, it's an important period for resting and reorienting yourself. Your desires are more complex than usual, and when you do know what you want, you may not see an easy way to go after it! Ideally, this leads to creative solutions and detours. \n The Full Moon on the 12th is fantastic for opening up the lines of communication or making connections, reaching out, putting the word out, and making your ideas known. Mind you, there can be a rush to get something done and a harried pace, but this can also be an exciting time for discovering a passion or new interest. \n You benefit from feeling backed and respected, which can motivate you to work harder or to enjoy what you do more fully. Your interactions can be pleasantly spicy or intimacy-boosting. It\u2019s a fabulous time to get to know yourself better as you get in touch with your more profound needs and desires. Ultimately, relationships are likely to strengthen as you understand yourself better. \n Professional matters look bright, and you can be in an excellent position to arrive at a mutually beneficial agreement, cooperate with others, or receive helpful feedback this month. You can be managing financial support issues or formulating strategies for meeting your goals. Quiet study or research can yield the answers you need and perhaps some rewards. Further, focusing on something absorbing and pouring a lot of energy into a project you care about can boost your mood. \n Pursuing heartfelt activities and building alliances are in favor. Researching, editing, or otherwise going over business, health, and financial matters can be satisfying. Still, it can also be a time of new, unusual, or radically different interests. Your worldview is changing, and current events can be catalysts for exploring new ideas. Educational plans might shift, or a sudden opportunity for different experiences can emerge. \n On the 20th, the Sun heads to the top of your solar chart, increasing your ambition or sense of responsibility. After the New Moon on the 26th, you can start fresh with your image or career. There's lovely support for your ideas, learning, travel, and career aspirations in the last week of May. \n You might receive special attention in the last week of the month, or certain plans come together as details emerge. This can be a significant period for your work, career, life path, or direction as the Sun and Mercury align at the top of your solar chart. New insights into your career path or business projects can emerge, which can propel you forward or motivate you. Meaningful conversations or communications occur that help you turn a corner. \n More:  Monthly Horoscopes \u2013 Details \n \u00a0 \n \n This Year: Virgo \n 2025  Overview \n The year ahead brings the potential for growth with your social life, happiness goals, work, and reputation, dear Virgo. Particularly from February to June, you might enjoy positive exposure, promotion, or career recognition or growth. You are learning to \u201cown\u201d what you do and feeling more comfortable in a position of leadership or authority. At the same time, you\u2019re taking more pride in your home and family. \n June forward brings a new focus, a time when your social life blossoms. Through groups or friends, you might seek a sense of belonging and comfort, and you\u2019re likely to find it! It\u2019s also a time for new and exciting ideas for future growth and happiness. You\u2019re entertaining dreams of where you\u2019d like to go with your life, and while it was your professional life that you were more interested in in the first half of 2025, the focus is increasingly on personal happiness, ideals, and long-term goals in the second half. \n There can be a cause that you work towards enthusiastically, possibly related to family. Business income is likely to be strong. Patience and a sense of peace with what you have or what you want are with you now. Teaming up with others can figure strongly this year and bring real benefits to your life. This is not only about working with others, but about the potential for real benefits and growth that come from collaboration. You might connect with people who inspire you and motivate you to be your best simply because they see the best in you. \n The year is about blossoming and demanding a little more from your life, and you\u2019re likely to get it. Either you are moving toward identifying with a new path, or some changes are introduced to you, and rethinking things becomes necessary. Daily habits and routines are transforming again this year, and you have many opportunities to make meaningful changes. At the same time, your vision of your future, social standing, or career is morphing, especially if you\u2019ve felt confined or inauthentic in these life departments in the past. \n A long-term influence that has affected your partnerships for many years is nearing a close in 2025. This influence has likely brought some confusion, and possibly some disillusionment, to your relationships, and it\u2019s wrapping up. Your attractions and pleasures are changing. Love can be found or enhanced through your work, health pursuits, or passion projects. \n More:  Virgo 2025  \n See also:  2025 Virgo Preview Horoscope \n \n This Year in Love: Virgo \n 2025 Love Horoscope for Virgo \n The year 2025 features eclipses occurring in your sign and your partnership sector, dear Virgo, and you\u2019re exploring your identity and defining your needs from partnership. \n With the North Node moving into your partnership sector this year, there are great rewards and benefits (and perhaps some challenges) related to one-to-one relationships. The path to fulfillment involves recognizing your relationship needs. The challenge is to work on sensitizing yourself to the needs of others and to get over any fears of the demands a partner or significant people in your life might make on you. \n In fact, you continue to experience powerful eclipses \u2014 in 2025, these happen in your sign and your opposing sign \u2014 and they encourage you to make big decisions about how you live your life vis a vis partnerships. The first of this series occurred in September 2024, and the last will occur in February 2027. \n This year, a Lunar Eclipse occurs in your sign in March, signaling that it\u2019s time to change your image or redefine your personality in some manner. Finding a balance between autonomy and dependence is what this eclipse is about for you. Your emotions are on your sleeve. It is a good time to put your needs first, but doing so with respect for others will take you further. Whether you can succeed as a leader is \u201ctested\u201d right now. March looks to be a month of changes in yourself and an intimate relationship or your intimate world. \n Saturn is near the end of its transit of your opposite sign and partnership sector. The final date is February 13th, 2026. In 2025, Saturn continues here until May 24th and then from September 1st onward to February 13th, 2026. \n Neptune is on a similar path: Neptune is transitioning out of your opposite sign this year. But while Saturn was here since 2023, Neptune has been opposing your sign since 2011!\u2026 cont\u2019d \n More:  2025 Virgo Love Horoscope \n Special note concerning Covid-19 \n Special note: \n Astrological transits continue in their cyclical ways no matter the current situation. They should always be adapted to what\u2019s going on in your life in sensible ways. This applies at all times, but is particularly relevant now during this health crisis. During the quarantines, if the planetary transits are suggesting it\u2019s a great time to socialize, for example, it makes sense to adapt this to online socializing. Let\u2019s be safe and protect one another through social distancing, when possible. Much love, Annie (March 18, 2020) \n My heart goes out to all those experiencing difficulty. Love, Annie (April 1, 2020)"

            "highlights": "2025  Overview \n The year ahead brings the potential for growth with your social life, happiness goals, work, and reputation, dear Virgo. Particularly from February to June, you might enjoy positive exposure, promotion, or career recognition or growth. You are learning to \u201cown\u201d what you do and feeling more comfortable in a position of leadership or authority. At the same time, you\u2019re taking more pride in your home and family. \n June forward brings a new focus, a time when your social life blossoms. Through groups or friends, you might seek a sense of belonging and comfort, and you\u2019re likely to find it! It\u2019s also a time for new and exciting ideas for future growth and happiness. You\u2019re entertaining dreams of where you\u2019d like to go with your life, and while it was your professional life that you were more interested in in the first half of 2025, the focus is increasingly on personal happiness, ideals, and long-term goals in the second half. \n There can be a cause that you work towards enthusiastically, possibly related to family. Business income is likely to be strong. Patience and a sense of peace with what you have or what you want are with you now. Teaming up with others can figure strongly this year and bring real benefits to your life. This is not only about working with others, but about the potential for real benefits and growth that come from collaboration. You might connect with people who inspire you and motivate you to be your best simply because they see the best in you. \n The year is about blossoming and demanding a little more from your life, and you\u2019re likely to get it. Either you are moving toward identifying with a new path, or some changes are introduced to you, and rethinking things becomes necessary. Daily habits and routines are transforming again this year, and you have many opportunities to make meaningful changes. At the same time, your vision of your future, social standing, or career is morphing, especially if you\u2019ve felt confined or inauthentic in these life departments in the past. \n A long-term influence that has affected your partnerships for many years is nearing a close in 2025. This influence has likely brought some confusion, and possibly some disillusionment, to your relationships, and it\u2019s wrapping up. Your attractions and pleasures are changing. Love can be found or enhanced through your work, health pursuits, or passion projects. \n More:  Virgo 2025  \n See also:  2025 Virgo Preview Horoscope \n \n This Year in Love: Virgo \n 2025 Love Horoscope for Virgo \n The year 2025 features eclipses occurring in your sign and your partnership sector, dear Virgo, and you\u2019re exploring your identity and defining your needs from partnership. \n With the North Node moving into your partnership sector this year, there are great rewards and benefits (and perhaps some challenges) related to one-to-one relationships. The path to fulfillment involves recognizing your relationship needs. The challenge is to work on sensitizing yourself to the needs of others and to get over any fears of the demands a partner or significant people in your life might make on you. \n In fact, you continue to experience powerful eclipses \u2014 in 2025, these happen in your sign and your opposing sign \u2014 and they encourage you to make big decisions about how you live your life vis a vis partnerships. The first of this series occurred in September 2024, and the last will occur in February 2027. \n This year, a Lunar Eclipse occurs in your sign in March, signaling that it\u2019s time to change your image or redefine your personality in some manner. Finding a balance between autonomy and dependence is what this eclipse is about for you. Your emotions are on your sleeve. It is a good time to put your needs first, but doing so with respect for others will take you further. Whether you can succeed as a leader is \u201ctested\u201d right now. March looks to be a month of changes in yourself and an intimate relationship or your intimate world. \n Saturn is near the end of its transit of your opposite sign and partnership sector. The final date is February 13th, 2026. In 2025, Saturn continues here until May 24th and then from September 1st onward to February 13th, 2026. \n Neptune is on a similar path: Neptune is transitioning out of your opposite sign this year. But while Saturn was here since 2023, Neptune has been opposing your sign since 2011!\u2026 cont\u2019d \n More:  2025 Virgo Love Horoscope \n Special note concerning Covid-19 \n Special note: \n Astrological transits continue in their cyclical ways no matter the current situation. They should always be adapted to what\u2019s going on in your life in sensible ways. This applies at all times, but is particularly relevant now during this health crisis. During the quarantines, if the planetary transits are suggesting it\u2019s a great time to socialize, for example, it makes sense to adapt this to online socializing. Let\u2019s be safe and protect one another through social distancing, when possible. Much love, Annie (March 18, 2020) \n My heart goes out to all those experiencing difficulty. Love, Annie (April 1, 2020)",
            "forecast": "Specials \n This Month: Virgo \n June 2025 Monthly Horoscope Overview for Virgo: \n June is strong for attention to your long-term goals, reputation, career, and responsibilities, dear Virgo. It\u2019s a time to reach for new or redefined goals related to your life path. You are motivated to do your best or take the lead. \n Still, in the first half of the month, while there can be a flurry of activity, you don't necessarily have the personal energy to match, that is until Mars enters your sign on the 17th. You're more liable to make errors until then, but only if you are not listening to your body's signals to slow down. For the best results, do your best to keep up with opportunities, but don't push yourself to inhuman levels. Take the rest you need and pace yourself. \n Love is adventurous or spirited, and opportunities for financial gain often arise through a partner or the management of others' resources in June. Educational opportunities can open up from the 6th forward. Publishing or promotion can be in focus, and communications thrive. It's a time for feeling inspired, whether it\u2019s about your relationships, outlook, personal interests, or pleasing pastimes \u2014 or any combination of these! Aim high now, but not so high that you don\u2019t know where to begin. Your sign is all for reasonable and practical goals, so you shouldn\u2019t have too many problems with this. These themes are due to Venus in your solar ninth house--a supportive transit that gently encourages you and helps boost your popularity. \n It\u2019s also a time to see solutions to problems related to career or life path goals. You're hungry to learn new things and come to conclusions and resolutions! Transits facilitate conversations with people who can help you achieve your goals. It\u2019s a great time for optimism and hope or supportive news that excites you about your future. Who you know may be important now, but your positivity and confidence are key. \n The Full Moon on the 11th opens your eyes to a home or family matter. You may have been feeling stuck or in limbo, which can lead to an epiphany about your domestic world or the need for nurture, comfort, and safety. \n Mercury transits your social sector from the 8th to the 26th, increasing your attention to happiness goals, friendships, community involvement, and social activities. You could find yourself taking an interest in something entirely new now. The goals are to feel connected and contributing. \n Still, energy has been low recently with an extended stay of Mars in your privacy sector. As such, you may have had a hard time knowing how or where to focus your attention. However, with Mars entering your sign on the 17th, clarity comes. You are in take-charge mode, ready to take on a challenge, and willing to put yourself out to get where you want to go. This is also a powerful time for attracting romantic attention. \n Mars moving into your sign can feel like a nice rush, although it can overstimulate you at times, particularly if you don\u2019t have a goal to work toward. Still, it's a solid period for pursuing your plans and dreams and reanimating! You can be excited about your projects and personal interests. It\u2019s a time for taking the initiative, but do watch for oversized tempers. When you properly channel your energy during this transit, you are highly dynamic and creative. Even though your independence is in strong force, you\u2019re also in touch with others, especially once the Sun enters your social sector on the 20th. \n Saturn recently moved into your solar eighth house, where it will transit until September 1st. There will be a lengthy Part Two of this Saturn transit occurring from February 2026 to April 2028. During this cycle, if there's been dullness or routine in your intimate life, you'll want to do something about it. You may be dealing with some restricted support or resources from a partner, or there's more responsibility with your resources or in a relationship. This is a time for learning to rely more faithfully on your ability to make a living. You would do well to organize your finances and get a stronger sense of where you stand in terms of indebtedness and support, as circumstances are such that you want to tidy up in these areas. \n Another big planetary shift occurs from June 9th forward, and it lasts for over a year: Jupiter heads into your social sector. Social activity increases, or you\u2019re more interested in connecting with friends, networks, the community, or your higher goals, dreams, and plans. In the year ahead, you\u2019ll meet people and enjoy valuable connections during Jupiter\u2019s travels here. You\u2019re pinning your hopes on beautiful things, making mutually beneficial connections, and dreaming and planning for the future. You may meet acquaintances who help you further your goals, or you could join a new group or association that gives you considerable pleasure and satisfaction. \n At times this month, intimate relationships or an increased need for privacy or exclusiveness can impact friendships and social goals\u2013and vice versa! There can be challenges, such as power struggles or concerns about betrayal or boundaries. The desire to enjoy friendships and sharing is strong, but something or someone may hold you back or temporarily stand in your way. The key now is to look for ways to simplify your life, remembering that quality is more important than quantity in these areas. By simplifying your life, you can regain a sense of control. \n The last part of the month brings a surge in energy and initiative, which will carry over into July. You feel more than confident and happy to take the lead. While you\u2019re willing to move past obstacles now, there are fewer of them to deal with! Be as open, willing, positive, and faithful as feels comfortable. Something might inspire you to move forward on a personal goal, dream, or plan after the New Moon on the 25th. You suddenly see things as doable. There is some inclination to impulsiveness now with Mars in your sign, but if you are listening to gut instincts rather than simply reacting to people around you, then you\u2019re in good form. \n May 2025 Monthly Horoscope Overview for Virgo: \n There is a strong focus on adventure, spirit, and mind expansion this month, dear Virgo, but much is going on under the hood in May, especially with your intimate life and/or with money matters and support. Where there was some waiting, delays, and backtracking with these issues in April, doors are opening to you in May. The chances of smoothing over a disagreement or attracting the support you need are high. \n Your larger focus seems to be on the \u201cbig picture\u201d this month. You\u2019re seeking to stretch your mind. You see your heart more clearly, which also helps decision-making. Positive shifts can happen as you embrace exploring new subjects and places. Extra rest is crucial this month, but refreshing activities are essential, too. \n Pluto begins its yearly retrograde cycle on May 4th, and problem areas can magnify with the shift, likely related to work, routines, communications, and health. As you grow accustomed to this energy, you\u2019re in a brilliant position to review and reassess these matters as you gain perspective. You might more clearly see where you\u2019ve been over-attached or where you\u2019ve put too much pressure on yourself along these lines. \n Doing out-of-the-ordinary things or changing routines up is attractive in May, but there is a considerable focus on healing, resting, and tying up loose ends as Mars transits the sign just behind yours all month. You're gaining the motivation and energy to handle a matter that has been on your mind for some time. Otherwise, it's an important period for resting and reorienting yourself. Your desires are more complex than usual, and when you do know what you want, you may not see an easy way to go after it! Ideally, this leads to creative solutions and detours. \n The Full Moon on the 12th is fantastic for opening up the lines of communication or making connections, reaching out, putting the word out, and making your ideas known. Mind you, there can be a rush to get something done and a harried pace, but this can also be an exciting time for discovering a passion or new interest. \n You benefit from feeling backed and respected, which can motivate you to work harder or to enjoy what you do more fully. Your interactions can be pleasantly spicy or intimacy-boosting. It\u2019s a fabulous time to get to know yourself better as you get in touch with your more profound needs and desires. Ultimately, relationships are likely to strengthen as you understand yourself better. \n Professional matters look bright, and you can be in an excellent position to arrive at a mutually beneficial agreement, cooperate with others, or receive helpful feedback this month. You can be managing financial support issues or formulating strategies for meeting your goals. Quiet study or research can yield the answers you need and perhaps some rewards. Further, focusing on something absorbing and pouring a lot of energy into a project you care about can boost your mood. \n Pursuing heartfelt activities and building alliances are in favor. Researching, editing, or otherwise going over business, health, and financial matters can be satisfying. Still, it can also be a time of new, unusual, or radically different interests. Your worldview is changing, and current events can be catalysts for exploring new ideas. Educational plans might shift, or a sudden opportunity for different experiences can emerge. \n On the 20th, the Sun heads to the top of your solar chart, increasing your ambition or sense of responsibility. After the New Moon on the 26th, you can start fresh with your image or career. There's lovely support for your ideas, learning, travel, and career aspirations in the last week of May. \n You might receive special attention in the last week of the month, or certain plans come together as details emerge. This can be a significant period for your work, career, life path, or direction as the Sun and Mercury align at the top of your solar chart. New insights into your career path or business projects can emerge, which can propel you forward or motivate you. Meaningful conversations or communications occur that help you turn a corner. \n More:  Monthly Horoscopes \u2013 Details \n \u00a0 \n \n This Year: Virgo \n 2025  Overview \n The year ahead brings the potential for growth with your social life, happiness goals, work, and reputation, dear Virgo.

If you're looking for support, advice, and structure, you're likely to find these things through the people you connect with today as the Moon and Saturn harmonize. Saturn has recently moved into your opposing sign, where it will transit for a good portion of the coming three years (until September 1st this year and then from February 2026 to April 2028). It's a long-term cycle in which relationships may go through some tests. You could be easing slowly but surely into a more committed, stable relationship or questioning your current relationship or relationship status.

You'll find that everyday problem areas appear rather insignificant in comparison to the big picture. This is a strong month for relationship and intimacy' repair,' if necessary, and your personal magnetism is often fueled by your ability to bond and discuss personal matters this month. While there's increased activity and demand in the first half of June, the tempo changes considerably as the month advances, when ambitions are stirring, but personal energy levels may dip. \n New ideas and inspiration can be discovered through sharing and networking efforts. You\u2019re seeking something more meaningful or interesting to wrap your mind around. Energy flows particularly well for most mental and communicative matters. Your optimism can prompt you to consider something you never felt was in the realm of possibility. \n The month brings easy energy for studies, small adventures, and interesting happenings. Significant events are possible with friends or group associations. In the second half of the month, you\u2019re connecting more fully with your ambition, but you also recognize a strong need for a little space as Mars moves into your privacy sector. It\u2019s a time for perhaps rethinking some goals or drives but also for reorienting yourself and replenishing your energy stores. \n Venus transits your intimacy sector from the 6th forward, and you\u2019re inclined to tap into and explore your affections at their deepest level. You\u2019re skilled at getting the most out of situations and improving or deepening relationships now. This is a powerful time for helping others and encouraging them to make the most of their talents or otherwise thrive and enrich their lives. \n From the 8th to the 26th, Mercury transits your solar tenth house, and you\u2019ll find yourself adapting and adjusting in ways that benefit your career, reputation, status, or long-term goals. It\u2019s an intelligent and practical time. Besides calling upon your versatility and putting this trait to full use, it\u2019s a great time for bringing your knowledge, expertise, and intelligence to your professional or public life. You may be watching what you say more than usual now. You\u2019re a shock absorber of sorts during this transit as you take things in stride, mediate, and help everyone get along. \n The Full Moon on the 11th brings a sudden need to pay more attention to news and the goings-on close to home. Good news about a writing or learning assignment can come now, or your personal interests and projects can reach a turning point. If you\u2019ve been focusing too heavily on outside interests and neglecting your daily affairs, this Full Moon reminds you to balance your life. It\u2019s important to get on top of errands and paperwork now. \n Mars moving into your privacy sector on the 17th can slow you down a little, at least long enough to reassess recent activities, desires, and goals. If you've been overexerting yourself, you'll now need to observe some quiet time. Pacing yourself means everything with this transit! \n While there can be problems getting to the root of irritation or anger with Mars\u2019 transit through your solar twelfth house from the 17th forward, you can find much to enjoy as you attempt to understand your inner workings. Your actions in the real world may not seem as effective or they could go unnoticed, but self-knowledge helps you a lot and prepares you for the exciting transit of Mars through your sign from August 6th to September 22nd. You may be processing a lot, and not quite ready to make a big move or change until then. Be patient with this \u2014 it\u2019s an important process and a natural progression. \n Saturn has recently moved into your opposing sign, and this longer-term transit will be with you until September 1st and then from February 2026 to April 2028. You might be easing slowly but surely into a more committed, stable relationship, or you could be questioning your current relationship or relationship status. You\u2019ve recently learned to live a more structured life, and now, you\u2019re applying these things to your connections. \n This month, Jupiter makes its way to the top of your solar chart. While it does push for achievement, it also brings a sense of joy and meaning to your career pursuits. This influence is not fleeting, as Jupiter will bless your career and ambitions for over a year, until June 2026. This is big news, as Jupiter only makes a sign change every thirteen months or so! Your reputation is set to improve significantly this year. On the career front, there\u2019s potential for adventure and freedom. Whether you\u2019re more adventurous with your career or you enjoy more freedom with your work, this period is about growing your long-term goals and prospects. \n It\u2019s a time to discover more joy in following your ambitions and performing or excelling. Working towards a well-defined goal can be motivating and satisfying, although this goal may not be fully fleshed out just yet. Your position with bosses, parents, teachers, or authorities can improve wonderfully in the year ahead. Even so, you\u2019re making your own career opportunities with a confident attitude. \n Balancing your relationships or relationship goals with career goals and responsibilities to the outside world can be a challenge at times this month. These life departments clash or compete at the moment! A partner or significant person could question your ambitions or vie for your attention, competing with your special interest in your career or outside responsibilities. Others\u2019 expectations of you or their limits, rules, and critical observations can impact your performance. \n Business and career matters continue to pick up pace as the month advances, particularly from the 20th onward, when performance begins to matter more than it has in recent weeks. Brand new beginnings and projects related to business and finances are best left for the weeks following the New Moon on the 25th, but your efforts to connect with others and seek out advice can be very fruitful now. While you're a little more insular, you're also strongly motivated to take care of business. You have a wonderful sense of what people want. \n \u00a0 \n May 2025 Monthly Horoscope Overview for Libra: \n Relationships, finances, passion, intimacy, education, and adventure make up the larger themes of May for you, dear Libra, and are areas of increased focus and opportunity. Learning and exploring with a partner or good friend can be very beneficial now. It can be an uplifting time of more honesty and warm experiences and activities with a special person, as well as boosts to a relationship. A partner or your relationship goals could play a vital role in motivating you to learn or do more. \n Where you may have felt stuck, in limbo, or delayed in April, more clarity arrives in May. This month is strong for a sense that you\u2019re getting back on track. Relationships smooth over. Your stellar ability to compromise, negotiate, and bring balance to your life is back up to par and then some! \n You can be very active with friends and groups this month, but you\u2019re also easily absorbed in your private life, ideally finding the right balance between the two. You might find that you achieve the most or are the most motivated through your involvement with a group or team. You may be more active with friends and associates, perhaps actively working towards a cherished cause or dream. \n It's a time when you\u2019re not particularly content with simply dreaming, wishing, and hoping for better circumstances. You\u2019ll want to take solid action toward realizing your goals and making improvements. There can be a strong focus on new technology or methods. You\u2019re inventive and drawn to endeavors that are forward-looking and unique. \n Even so, in many ways, this is a month for soul-searching, digging, and investigating.

You\u2019re getting in better touch with your inner power and recognizing and building support from others. \n Pluto begins its yearly retrograde cycle on May 4th.

You'll find that everyday problem areas appear rather insignificant in comparison to the big picture. This is a strong month for relationship and intimacy' repair,' if necessary, and your personal magnetism is often fueled by your ability to bond and discuss personal matters this month. While there's increased activity and demand in the first half of June, the tempo changes considerably as the month advances, when ambitions are stirring, but personal energy levels may dip. \n New ideas and inspiration can be discovered through sharing and networking efforts. You\u2019re seeking something more meaningful or interesting to wrap your mind around. Energy flows particularly well for most mental and communicative matters. Your optimism can prompt you to consider something you never felt was in the realm of possibility. \n The month brings easy energy for studies, small adventures, and interesting happenings. Significant events are possible with friends or group associations. In the second half of the month, you\u2019re connecting more fully with your ambition, but you also recognize a strong need for a little space as Mars moves into your privacy sector. It\u2019s a time for perhaps rethinking some goals or drives but also for reorienting yourself and replenishing your energy stores. \n Venus transits your intimacy sector from the 6th forward, and you\u2019re inclined to tap into and explore your affections at their deepest level. You\u2019re skilled at getting the most out of situations and improving or deepening relationships now. This is a powerful time for helping others and encouraging them to make the most of their talents or otherwise thrive and enrich their lives. \n From the 8th to the 26th, Mercury transits your solar tenth house, and you\u2019ll find yourself adapting and adjusting in ways that benefit your career, reputation, status, or long-term goals. It\u2019s an intelligent and practical time. Besides calling upon your versatility and putting this trait to full use, it\u2019s a great time for bringing your knowledge, expertise, and intelligence to your professional or public life. You may be watching what you say more than usual now. You\u2019re a shock absorber of sorts during this transit as you take things in stride, mediate, and help everyone get along. \n The Full Moon on the 11th brings a sudden need to pay more attention to news and the goings-on close to home. Good news about a writing or learning assignment can come now, or your personal interests and projects can reach a turning point. If you\u2019ve been focusing too heavily on outside interests and neglecting your daily affairs, this Full Moon reminds you to balance your life. It\u2019s important to get on top of errands and paperwork now. \n Mars moving into your privacy sector on the 17th can slow you down a little, at least long enough to reassess recent activities, desires, and goals. If you've been overexerting yourself, you'll now need to observe some quiet time. Pacing yourself means everything with this transit! \n While there can be problems getting to the root of irritation or anger with Mars\u2019 transit through your solar twelfth house from the 17th forward, you can find much to enjoy as you attempt to understand your inner workings. Your actions in the real world may not seem as effective or they could go unnoticed, but self-knowledge helps you a lot and prepares you for the exciting transit of Mars through your sign from August 6th to September 22nd. You may be processing a lot, and not quite ready to make a big move or change until then. Be patient with this \u2014 it\u2019s an important process and a natural progression. \n Saturn has recently moved into your opposing sign, and this longer-term transit will be with you until September 1st and then from February 2026 to April 2028. You might be easing slowly but surely into a more committed, stable relationship, or you could be questioning your current relationship or relationship status. You\u2019ve recently learned to live a more structured life, and now, you\u2019re applying these things to your connections. \n This month, Jupiter makes its way to the top of your solar chart. While it does push for achievement, it also brings a sense of joy and meaning to your career pursuits. This influence is not fleeting, as Jupiter will bless your career and ambitions for over a year, until June 2026. This is big news, as Jupiter only makes a sign change every thirteen months or so! Your reputation is set to improve significantly this year. On the career front, there\u2019s potential for adventure and freedom. Whether you\u2019re more adventurous with your career or you enjoy more freedom with your work, this period is about growing your long-term goals and prospects. \n It\u2019s a time to discover more joy in following your ambitions and performing or excelling. Working towards a well-defined goal can be motivating and satisfying, although this goal may not be fully fleshed out just yet. Your position with bosses, parents, teachers, or authorities can improve wonderfully in the year ahead. Even so, you\u2019re making your own career opportunities with a confident attitude. \n Balancing your relationships or relationship goals with career goals and responsibilities to the outside world can be a challenge at times this month. These life departments clash or compete at the moment! A partner or significant person could question your ambitions or vie for your attention, competing with your special interest in your career or outside responsibilities. Others\u2019 expectations of you or their limits, rules, and critical observations can impact your performance. \n Business and career matters continue to pick up pace as the month advances, particularly from the 20th onward, when performance begins to matter more than it has in recent weeks. Brand new beginnings and projects related to business and finances are best left for the weeks following the New Moon on the 25th, but your efforts to connect with others and seek out advice can be very fruitful now. While you're a little more insular, you're also strongly motivated to take care of business. You have a wonderful sense of what people want. \n \u00a0 \n May 2025 Monthly Horoscope Overview for Libra: \n Relationships, finances, passion, intimacy, education, and adventure make up the larger themes of May for you, dear Libra, and are areas of increased focus and opportunity. Learning and exploring with a partner or good friend can be very beneficial now. It can be an uplifting time of more honesty and warm experiences and activities with a special person, as well as boosts to a relationship. A partner or your relationship goals could play a vital role in motivating you to learn or do more. \n Where you may have felt stuck, in limbo, or delayed in April, more clarity arrives in May. This month is strong for a sense that you\u2019re getting back on track. Relationships smooth over. Your stellar ability to compromise, negotiate, and bring balance to your life is back up to par and then some! \n You can be very active with friends and groups this month, but you\u2019re also easily absorbed in your private life, ideally finding the right balance between the two. You might find that you achieve the most or are the most motivated through your involvement with a group or team. You may be more active with friends and associates, perhaps actively working towards a cherished cause or dream. \n It's a time when you\u2019re not particularly content with simply dreaming, wishing, and hoping for better circumstances. You\u2019ll want to take solid action toward realizing your goals and making improvements. There can be a strong focus on new technology or methods. You\u2019re inventive and drawn to endeavors that are forward-looking and unique. \n Even so, in many ways, this is a month for soul-searching, digging, and investigating. You may be doing a lot of observing and planning, and you\u2019re inclined to pour quite a bit of energy into engrossing projects and interests. You\u2019re getting in better touch with your inner power and recognizing and building support from others. \n Pluto begins its yearly retrograde cycle on May 4th.

Learning and exploring with a partner or good friend can be very beneficial now. It can be an uplifting time of more honesty and warm experiences and activities with a special person, as well as boosts to a relationship. A partner or your relationship goals could play a vital role in motivating you to learn or do more. \n Where you may have felt stuck, in limbo, or delayed in April, more clarity arrives in May. This month is strong for a sense that you\u2019re getting back on track. Relationships smooth over. Your stellar ability to compromise, negotiate, and bring balance to your life is back up to par and then some! \n You can be very active with friends and groups this month, but you\u2019re also easily absorbed in your private life, ideally finding the right balance between the two. You might find that you achieve the most or are the most motivated through your involvement with a group or team. You may be more active with friends and associates, perhaps actively working towards a cherished cause or dream. \n It's a time when you\u2019re not particularly content with simply dreaming, wishing, and hoping for better circumstances. You\u2019ll want to take solid action toward realizing your goals and making improvements. There can be a strong focus on new technology or methods. You\u2019re inventive and drawn to endeavors that are forward-looking and unique. \n Even so, in many ways, this is a month for soul-searching, digging, and investigating. You may be doing a lot of observing and planning, and you\u2019re inclined to pour quite a bit of energy into engrossing projects and interests. You\u2019re getting in better touch with your inner power and recognizing and building support from others. \n Pluto begins its yearly retrograde cycle on May 4th. With the shift, there can be a temporary magnification of problems, complications, and fears related to those areas of your chart strongly influenced by Pluto: romance, creativity, recreation, finances, and security.\u00a0Pressures will subside going forward, and\u00a0in fact,\u00a0you\u2019ll reach the point where you\u2019re significantly detached enough to gain a better perspective on these things.\u00a0This way, you can more clearly see where fear and over-attachment may have worked against you. This\u00a0powerful\u00a0period for self-knowledge continues until October. \n This is also a potentially strengthening month for close relationships. You\u2019re clearer about who you care about and who has your back. Meeting people through your personal interests, studies, or travels is likely. You are better able to express yourself and to \"get\" others. This month, you enjoy more ease in social situations and possibly romantic excitement. You want to break out of the mold or routine in various ways through what you learn and where you go. Certainly, you\u2019re more courageous and motivated to try new things. \n Around the Full Moon on the 12th, you\u2019re in particularly good shape for making financial discoveries and adjustments. You're recognizing your worth or value and seeking out your rightful share. A conversation or news arrives now that nudges you toward these epiphanies. A business deal or project might come to full bloom now. Ownership, sharing, power, and money matters can be up for change or improvement. \n Sharing your feelings or intimate matters can be fun and rewarding, especially from the 10th to the 25th. You might open up a topic that is usually taboo or left unspoken. Healthy, frank discussions boost your relationships. \n Mars spending the month in your social sector can animate your friendships, group associations, and happiness goals. At the same time, it\u2019s likely to stir up problem areas that may have been brewing under the surface with friends or networks. \n The Sun moves into harmony with your sign and into your spirit sector on the 20th, launching a month-long cycle in which you feel more vibrant and connected to your dreams and goals. You're opening up to new ideas and mental explorations. The New Moon on the 26th brings a fresh start with special interests, adventures, or legal matters. \n In the last days of the month, you\u2019re excited about expanding a business, relationship \u2014 or your mind and experiences. Illumination can occur on a mental level, and there can be a clearing of the air or an important discovery or connection made this week. The desire to share your philosophy or unique perspective can be powerful. Doing your own thing, perhaps ironically, gets you closer to others. \n More:  Monthly Horoscopes \u2013 Details \n \u00a0 \n \n \u00a0 \n This Year: Libra \n 2025  Overview \n The year ahead promises to be strong for direction, work, and business, dear Libra. Energies are robust for honing your skills and gaining experience, particularly in the first half of the year. As expansive Jupiter ascends to the top of your solar chart by June, it marks a personal peak that will accompany you for over a year, bringing a wave of growth and opportunity. \n You\u2019re opening your mind to new ideas and concepts this year. Favorable connections with people from distant places are on the horizon, and some of you may even find your voice reaching a wider audience. Embracing experiences with people from vastly different cultures can be a catalyst for personal growth and a source of profound insights. \n In the second half of the year, you\u2019ll have Jupiter reminding you that you deserve more and should reach for the stars, while Saturn has been encouraging you to consider essential details. You are also bringing more imagination to your work, and your intuition can serve you well. There will be times this year when you need to consciously push yourself to go after what you want. In the process, try to avoid worrying about coming across as \u201cnice\u201d and \u201cgood\u201d. You\u00a0 are \u00a0these things \u2013 you don\u2019t need to prove it. You don\u2019t want to miss out on opportunities to advance out of fear of losing others\u2019 approval. In truth, this year is strong for building a solid reputation. \n The year may start with a slow, retrograde-ridden pace, but it also offers you the chance to review and reassess your current projects and goals. Despite the focus on achievement and performance in 2025, you\u2019ll find yourself investing more time, energy, and resources in your leisure, entertainment, and pastimes. Longer-term influences in your work and health sector are transitioning out, relieving some of the pressures on your everyday life. With this shift, more clarity and purpose will gradually but steadily come to you. \n Aim to use the power of Pluto to learn to love and value yourself more. In previous years, Pluto was in a sign that was incompatible with yours, and this has served to magnify some of your insecurities. Now that Pluto is harmonizing with your sign, harness its power to heal and strengthen by ridding yourself of attitudes and habits that make you feel less powerful\u2026 \n \n More:  2025 Libra  \n See also:  2025 Libra Preview Horoscope . \n \u00a0 \n \n \u00a0 \n This Year in Love: Libra \n 2025 Love Horoscope for Libra \n Jupiter continues to transit your spirit and adventure sector until June 9th this year, dear Libra, and its harmony with your sign is strong for  reducing stress or boosting your outlook .

This influence adds a nice layer or padding to your very  spirit .

You're craving a little more order in your life, and you're quite willing to put in the effort to make it happen as the Moon harmonizes with Saturn. Saturn recently began its long-term transit of your work and health sector, where it will continue until September 1st, but it will return from February 2026 to April 2028. In other words, it will spend time here for much of the coming three years, with a hiatus from September to February. With this rather strict planet monitoring your daily routines, it's a time to make critical changes in your daily habits. It\u2019s a strong influence for health improvement, cutting back, and healthier, more structured routines. You might land a position that requires more structure and effort. Discipline and a slow-but-steady approach work better than bold moves in these areas.

You\u2019re not in any mood to be told what to do, preferring to lead the way yourself in May. Mars brings extra muscle and motivation to your career, image, status, and responsibilities. You're in fine shape for sorting out your duties, organizing your personal and workspace, and researching your options. \n You\u2019re more invested than usual in the success of your relationships this month, and negotiations and diplomacy are highlighted. Fortunately, Venus is back in the game, and relating is more straightforward. \n Pluto begins its retrograde cycle on May 4th, positioning you well to review, reassess, and gain a new perspective about areas of your chart strongly influenced by Pluto: your personal goals, personality, security, comfort, family, and home or domestic life. Some related plans may need adjustment, but you might find it easier to detach from pressures and fears in these areas.\u00a0You\u2019ll find this process more comfortable as you grow more accustomed to this energy. \n Even so, where there were delays, confusion, and irritations in April, you\u2019ll enjoy forward movement, corrected courses, and clarifications in May. The areas most affected by slowdowns have been relationships, work, routines, and health. Further clarity comes to these areas of life in May, and perhaps some second chances to work things out. This month not only eases you forward, but it also features some very supportive influences for your partnerships and finances. \n With Mars at the top of your solar chart, you can be especially dynamic with business, career, and life plans. It certainly helps that you have boosted charisma on the job with Venus moving through your work and health sector all month. Your ambitions are stirring, and you're taking the lead. \n Improvements in your routines, habits, and everyday life that enhance your intimate life or feelings of personal empowerment can be in the spotlight this month. You\u2019re also working on making your connections stronger and happier, and you have cosmic support for this task. \n Around the Full Moon on the 12th can be an especially illuminating period. Projects come to bloom, and you come into touch with your true feelings on a matter. What you\u2019ve been brushing to the side can no longer be ignored! This can be a magical time for relationships but also for self-discovery, as this Full Moon occurs in your sign. Your intuitive feelers are on double duty! It can be an important time to check in with those feelings and desires you\u2019ve brushed off or left unfulfilled. \n May can also be a significant money month, not necessarily for windfalls but for getting good deals or gaining support more effortlessly. You don\u2019t shy away from dealing with imbalances of power or from tricky, taboo topics this month, and you\u2019re ready to take charge in your intimate life, especially in the last week of May. \n This can be a time of increased activity in your career, but you may also feel a strong desire to take the lead and act independently. In your personal life, however, you\u2019re in an entirely different frame of mind. Collaboration and cooperation are in focus. \n The lines of communication open with a significant other or good friend, especially from the 10th to the 25th. You\u2019re in a particularly good light on the job, at the gym, or other activities related to your daily routines and health pursuits, leading to social or romantic opportunities or simply more pleasure in your everyday life. \n A significant other can help give you perspective this month and shared plans and ideas can improve your bond. Energies are excellent for conversations with a partner, advisor, or counselor. Others can be your sounding board. Listen when people compliment you or recognize your talents and potential, as the feedback can be precious to you now. \n The last week of the month includes a New Moon in your intimacy and sharing sector, prompting the urge or need to start fresh. It's a fine time for exciting lifestyle changes and feeling on top of things. Transits support building exciting strategies for your work or future. You might also see an intimate relationship, your personal psychology and inner desires, or financial issues more clearly now. Solving a mystery can be rewarding, or you might have a particularly illuminating discussion about a matter that was previously hidden, kept under wraps, or incredibly complicated. \n More:  Monthly Horoscopes \u2013 Details \n \u00a0 \n \n \u00a0 \n This Year: Scorpio \n \u00a0 \n 2025  Overview \n The year ahead is strong for passion projects, shared resources, intimacy, publishing, and connecting, dear Scorpio.

            "forecast": "Specials \n \u00a0 \n This Month: Scorpio \n Scorpio \n May 2025 Monthly Horoscope Overview for Scorpio: \n You are more ambitious than usual and quite focused on accomplishment this month, dear Scorpio. You\u2019re not in any mood to be told what to do, preferring to lead the way yourself in May. Mars brings extra muscle and motivation to your career, image, status, and responsibilities. You're in fine shape for sorting out your duties, organizing your personal and workspace, and researching your options. \n You\u2019re more invested than usual in the success of your relationships this month, and negotiations and diplomacy are highlighted. Fortunately, Venus is back in the game, and relating is more straightforward. \n Pluto begins its retrograde cycle on May 4th, positioning you well to review, reassess, and gain a new perspective about areas of your chart strongly influenced by Pluto: your personal goals, personality, security, comfort, family, and home or domestic life. Some related plans may need adjustment, but you might find it easier to detach from pressures and fears in these areas.\u00a0You\u2019ll find this process more comfortable as you grow more accustomed to this energy. \n Even so, where there were delays, confusion, and irritations in April, you\u2019ll enjoy forward movement, corrected courses, and clarifications in May. The areas most affected by slowdowns have been relationships, work, routines, and health. Further clarity comes to these areas of life in May, and perhaps some second chances to work things out. This month not only eases you forward, but it also features some very supportive influences for your partnerships and finances. \n With Mars at the top of your solar chart, you can be especially dynamic with business, career, and life plans. It certainly helps that you have boosted charisma on the job with Venus moving through your work and health sector all month. Your ambitions are stirring, and you're taking the lead. \n Improvements in your routines, habits, and everyday life that enhance your intimate life or feelings of personal empowerment can be in the spotlight this month. You\u2019re also working on making your connections stronger and happier, and you have cosmic support for this task. \n Around the Full Moon on the 12th can be an especially illuminating period. Projects come to bloom, and you come into touch with your true feelings on a matter. What you\u2019ve been brushing to the side can no longer be ignored! This can be a magical time for relationships but also for self-discovery, as this Full Moon occurs in your sign. Your intuitive feelers are on double duty! It can be an important time to check in with those feelings and desires you\u2019ve brushed off or left unfulfilled. \n May can also be a significant money month, not necessarily for windfalls but for getting good deals or gaining support more effortlessly. You don\u2019t shy away from dealing with imbalances of power or from tricky, taboo topics this month, and you\u2019re ready to take charge in your intimate life, especially in the last week of May. \n This can be a time of increased activity in your career, but you may also feel a strong desire to take the lead and act independently. In your personal life, however, you\u2019re in an entirely different frame of mind. Collaboration and cooperation are in focus. \n The lines of communication open with a significant other or good friend, especially from the 10th to the 25th. You\u2019re in a particularly good light on the job, at the gym, or other activities related to your daily routines and health pursuits, leading to social or romantic opportunities or simply more pleasure in your everyday life. \n A significant other can help give you perspective this month and shared plans and ideas can improve your bond. Energies are excellent for conversations with a partner, advisor, or counselor. Others can be your sounding board. Listen when people compliment you or recognize your talents and potential, as the feedback can be precious to you now. \n The last week of the month includes a New Moon in your intimacy and sharing sector, prompting the urge or need to start fresh. It's a fine time for exciting lifestyle changes and feeling on top of things. Transits support building exciting strategies for your work or future. You might also see an intimate relationship, your personal psychology and inner desires, or financial issues more clearly now. Solving a mystery can be rewarding, or you might have a particularly illuminating discussion about a matter that was previously hidden, kept under wraps, or incredibly complicated. \n More:  Monthly Horoscopes \u2013 Details \n \u00a0 \n \n \u00a0 \n This Year: Scorpio \n \u00a0 \n 2025  Overview \n The year ahead is strong for passion projects, shared resources, intimacy, publishing, and connecting, dear Scorpio. Absorbing pursuits, deeper relationships, and exciting personal interests are in store. \n Until June, Jupiter is set to boost your financial and/or emotional support, especially from a partner or close friend. Your intimate world is rich. Combining your resources and talents with a partner can significantly improve your financial outlook. However, be prepared for potential changes in money from other sources as the year progresses. Fortunately, these surprises can bring detours that ultimately work in your favor. As you connect with your deeper desires and ambitions, your life path alters in interesting ways. \n The second half of the year is especially growth-oriented in more explicit, tangible ways. Benefits can come through long-distance experiences and people. Sharing beliefs can be a strong draw in your relationships, and your worldview expands in essential ways. It can be a wonderful period for connecting with others, even an audience, and both inspiring others and becoming inspired yourself. Your outlook is optimistic, especially with more rewarding pastimes and personal interests. \n You are looking for more from love \u2013 it\u2019s increasingly about intimacy in addition to mystical or romantic elements. You\u2019ve been attracting unusual, sometimes elusive or mysterious, people into your experience, but the astrological influence behind this long-term trend is on its way out. More stability on romantic and creative levels is on the horizon. \n It\u2019s important to be mindful of your body\u2019s needs for adequate rest, exercise, and nutrition this year. As you prioritize other pursuits, you may not always see these things clearly. Fundamental changes in how you approach your domestic world could be in the cards in 2025. An overhaul or purging could be worthwhile as you have different needs from your living arrangements. \n Deepening and expanding your knowledge can spark joy this year. It can also lead to meaningful experiences and adventures. Communication and transportation matters can improve, and new or better channels for connecting can expand your opportunities. \n More:  Scorpio 2025  \n See also  2025 Scorpio Preview \n \u00a0 \n \n \u00a0 \n This Year in Love: Scorpio \n \u00a0 \n 2025 Love Horoscope for Scorpio \n Jupiter continues to ramp up the intimacy level of a relationship until June 9th this year, dear Scorpio.

They should always be adapted to what\u2019s going on in your life in sensible ways. This applies at all times, but is particularly relevant now during this health crisis. During the quarantines, if the planetary transits are suggesting it\u2019s a great time to socialize, for example, it makes sense to adapt this to online socializing. Let\u2019s be safe and protect one another through social distancing, when possible. Much love, Annie (March 18, 2020) \n My heart goes out to all those experiencing difficulty. Love, Annie (April 1, 2020)"

Still, the Moon connects with structured Saturn in your creative sector, and your need for order and purpose is in the spotlight. So, while you're trying new things, you're doing so in moderation, and this can be ideal. Saturn has recently begun its transit of your sector of joy, and it will visit until September 1st and then from February 2026 to April 2028. This cycle introduces the idea that you may need to cut back on certain pleasures and hobbies or to bring more structure to your \u201cplay\u201d time. Hobbies might turn into work, love becomes a little more serious, and there may be fewer avenues for leisure open to you. With Saturn moving away from your family and home sector, responsibilities and pressures decrease on the domestic front. This also means that Saturn is now harmonizing with your sign--a stabilizing, grounding influence.

Conversations that left you stumped can start to make sense this month. \n Even so, Pluto begins its retrograde cycle on the 4th, which lasts over five months, putting you in a more reflective frame of mind. It\u2019s a great time to search deep within for answers. It\u2019s also a time to take a break from pushing yourself too hard mentally. Some projects may stall or need editing, adjustments, and refinements. While the shift can magnify fears and problem areas, as you adjust to this energy, you\u2019ll find this cycle quite valuable for self-understanding. \n There can be much activity and focus on work, analysis, reorganization, and fixing problem areas in your life. You\u2019re particularly motivated to do a good job, and you might thoroughly enjoy helping out others. You\u2019re more conscientious as a result and take pride in solving problems, acquiring or honing skills, and taking care of business.

Still, there is a lot of room for pleasant diversions and rewards. \n Around the Full Moon on the 12th, there can be an unexpected moment of truth and a need to rest, reflect, and otherwise pull yourself together. This is not about getting clear or reliable answers from the outside but about clear, intuitive flashes and realizations within you. You can discover how you actually feel about someone or something, and it may be hard to explain what brought you to your conclusions. Your instincts and intuition are working overtime now. It's a time to recognize your need to pay attention to and balance your mental and physical health. \n Focus on healing, reflecting, and reconnecting with some of the emotions you\u2019ve brushed aside in recent weeks. This way, you can bring your renewed self back to your work and self-care programs and do your best. \n Mars is a guest in your sector of spirit and adventure all month, fueling your energy and motivating you to reach beyond your usual limits. Certainly, your work and daily affairs can be exhausting at times, and there is a stronger and necessary focus on these things, but you\u2019re also finding the time to pursue other interests and activities that help nourish your soul and inspire you to reach higher. You\u2019re strongly motivated to learn, grow, improve, share, and connect. This can be a time for discovering a new passion or interest, or you could be rekindling an exciting project or study. Either way, you\u2019re enthusiastic. \n You are more attached than usual to your opinions, beliefs, traditions, and ideas this month, which can certainly contribute to some problems in your relationships, as you may create a stir occasionally. However, there is good energy with you for pursuing new interests and activities. Competitive activities can be attractive now. \n Your romantic or creative life is brighter and happier, and you get special help from Venus, which spends the month in your joy sector, boosting your appeal and personal confidence, and perhaps winning you some admirers, too. You\u2019re more spirited and confident and can be highly motivated to pursue a personal interest, particular topic, hobby, or creative activity. You might expand your horizons through an artistic pursuit or a hearty discussion. It\u2019s more comfortable to attract or enhance love.

The need for companionship might increase now. There can be more seriousness in your relationships and perhaps some balancing to do. The New Moon on the 26th clears the path for new beginnings or a fresh approach to partnerships. \n The last week of May is strong for relationship and creative excitement.

            "forecast": "Specials \n \n This Month: Sagittarius \n May 2025 Monthly Horoscope Overview for Sagittarius: \n The month ahead is powerful for taking care of business, improving routines and health, and enjoying and expressing yourself, dear Sagittarius. In other words, you're working and playing hard, and it's a nice balance. Mars animates your spirit sector, while charming Venus spends the month in your romance and creativity sector. It\u2019s a time for making connections, meeting people, and becoming more active with others. Learning and sharing can be exciting. \n You move beyond the blocks and delays of April and enjoy special attention, relationships, and improved routines in May. Problems straighten out, and answers or news you\u2019ve been waiting for arrive. Conversations that left you stumped can start to make sense this month. \n Even so, Pluto begins its retrograde cycle on the 4th, which lasts over five months, putting you in a more reflective frame of mind. It\u2019s a great time to search deep within for answers. It\u2019s also a time to take a break from pushing yourself too hard mentally. Some projects may stall or need editing, adjustments, and refinements. While the shift can magnify fears and problem areas, as you adjust to this energy, you\u2019ll find this cycle quite valuable for self-understanding. \n There can be much activity and focus on work, analysis, reorganization, and fixing problem areas in your life. You\u2019re particularly motivated to do a good job, and you might thoroughly enjoy helping out others. You\u2019re more conscientious as a result and take pride in solving problems, acquiring or honing skills, and taking care of business. You can be especially productive and enjoy the feeling of being useful. Still, there is a lot of room for pleasant diversions and rewards. \n Around the Full Moon on the 12th, there can be an unexpected moment of truth and a need to rest, reflect, and otherwise pull yourself together. This is not about getting clear or reliable answers from the outside but about clear, intuitive flashes and realizations within you. You can discover how you actually feel about someone or something, and it may be hard to explain what brought you to your conclusions. Your instincts and intuition are working overtime now. It's a time to recognize your need to pay attention to and balance your mental and physical health. \n Focus on healing, reflecting, and reconnecting with some of the emotions you\u2019ve brushed aside in recent weeks. This way, you can bring your renewed self back to your work and self-care programs and do your best. \n Mars is a guest in your sector of spirit and adventure all month, fueling your energy and motivating you to reach beyond your usual limits. Certainly, your work and daily affairs can be exhausting at times, and there is a stronger and necessary focus on these things, but you\u2019re also finding the time to pursue other interests and activities that help nourish your soul and inspire you to reach higher. You\u2019re strongly motivated to learn, grow, improve, share, and connect. This can be a time for discovering a new passion or interest, or you could be rekindling an exciting project or study. Either way, you\u2019re enthusiastic. \n You are more attached than usual to your opinions, beliefs, traditions, and ideas this month, which can certainly contribute to some problems in your relationships, as you may create a stir occasionally. However, there is good energy with you for pursuing new interests and activities. Competitive activities can be attractive now. \n Your romantic or creative life is brighter and happier, and you get special help from Venus, which spends the month in your joy sector, boosting your appeal and personal confidence, and perhaps winning you some admirers, too. You\u2019re more spirited and confident and can be highly motivated to pursue a personal interest, particular topic, hobby, or creative activity. You might expand your horizons through an artistic pursuit or a hearty discussion. It\u2019s more comfortable to attract or enhance love. You are magnetic, but you\u2019re also making happy things happen, and there is a beautiful, warm flow of friendliness between you and the people around you. \n It can be a lovely period for enhancing your relationships or love life. It\u2019s also a time when your self-honesty leads to more genuineness in your romantic world or creative output. \n Relationships come into stronger focus in the latter part of the month. The need for companionship might increase now. There can be more seriousness in your relationships and perhaps some balancing to do. The New Moon on the 26th clears the path for new beginnings or a fresh approach to partnerships. \n The last week of May is strong for relationship and creative excitement. Conversations or interactions with a significant person can be particularly illuminating, meaningful, or motivating. Sharing a vision or a unique experience can strengthen a bond. \n More:  Monthly Horoscopes \u2013 Details \n \u00a0 \n \n \u00a0 \n This Year: Sagittarius in 2025 \n The year ahead brings rewarding experiences with others and special attention to passion projects, dear Sagittarius. While close relationships are in strong focus this year, Sagittarians can be a little more private and introspective than usual in 2025. You might meet somebody who deepens your intimate life in remarkable ways, opening you up to new ways of expressing yourself, or if already attached, you might deepen your relationship similarly. New depths (and heights) can be experienced now and add to your inner glow. Love matters should be quite strong this year, with significant partnerships a great focus. \n Partnerships fare better than more casual love relationships, the latter being a little more complicated as your needs from these connections evolve. Even so, you\u2019re receiving Uranus as a guest in your partnership sector for part of 2025. This planet will soon set up shop in this area of your solar chart for years to come, changing up partnering experiences and needs. In truth, the dynamics of close partnerships (personal and business ones) begin shifting. This year, you\u2019re exploring matters of freedom, happiness, and growth in your relationships\u2013stale, overly rigid, and dull patterns stick out like a sore thumb now. \n Financial support in the form of loans or shared resources tends to be easier to come by from June forward, but it will be essential to watch your borrowing habits. There can be good publicity this year, and your ability to meet others halfway (often further) opens up social possibilities and opportunities. You are generous by nature with your ruling planet, expansive Jupiter. With Jupiter moving through two sectors of your chart associated with partners and close friends, you are directing much of this generosity to significant others in 2025. Enjoy yourself as you do, but watch for overblown expectations or promises that may be hard to keep later. \n Communication and learning are areas of evolution and change. Your powers of influence run exceptionally high \u2013 others are truly listening to what you have to say. You may also find great pleasure in research or other serious study.

You could tap into the motivation to do something positive and supportive, particularly related to domestic harmony or structure. As the Moon harmonizes with steady Saturn, it's a good time to take measured steps towards a goal rather than attempting to push forward quickly. Indeed, responsibilities seem to be on the increase in your personal life these days, but you feel more equipped than usual to take care of them right now. Saturn has recently begun its transit of your solar fourth house, where it will visit until September 1st and then from February 2026 to April 2028. Increased responsibilities with family are likely, but you can also feel more accomplished as you meet them. Look for problem areas in the home and family unit and get a jump start on fixing them since they\u2019re bound to emerge in the coming years. Domestic matters require more serious thought, self-discipline, and organization.

The Leo Moon is bold, creative, and competitive. \n However, Mercury forms a minor square with Chiron today, pointing to some hesitation in making decisions. \n This transit challenges us to communicate with more sensitivity. \n With Jupiter's biquintile with Pluto, we are deeply interested in \u2014 and skilled at \u2014 strategy for achieving our goals. \n It\u2019s a time of easily sniffing out opportunities. We can feel more in control of our creative powers or more aware of our deeper ambitions, and it's a constructive and empowering state of mind. \n We\u2019re ready and willing to challenge ourselves and move just a little out of our comfort zones to achieve something important to us. \n The Moon is void from 12:51 PM EDT, with the Moon's last aspect before changing signs (a sextile to Uranus), until the Moon enters Leo at 4:17 PM EDT. \n \n This Week in Astrology \n \u00a0 \n \n This Month: Capricorn \n May 2025 Monthly Horoscope Overview for Capricorn: \n The month ahead is one of diverse themes, dear Capricorn, but perhaps most importantly, you\u2019ll feel that you\u2019re moving forward in May. This comes as a relief after the sometimes stuck, \u201cin limbo\u201d vibe of previous months. May is a month of more clarity in your home life or with living conditions and arrangements. Romance, intimacy, and health are also in the spotlight. There is a strong focus on both work and play this month. \n Recreation, romance, creativity, pastimes, and hobbies can be sources of more pride, and involvement with these areas of life increases as the Sun transits your sector of joy until the 20th. You\u2019re getting in touch with your need to express yourself as an individual in May. You are putting your unique stamp on whatever you\u2019re doing, and this is an important process of self-discovery. \n Pluto begins its yearly retrograde cycle on the 4th, and this change of direction prompts you to review your financial affairs, attitude towards money and things, what and who you value, and self-worth. While fears or worries related to money and security can magnify as this shift happens, the retrograde cycle itself, lasting until October, helps you gain perspective. With less pressure on you to control or micromanage your practical affairs, your choices and decisions improve! Even so, it\u2019s important not to push matters that must evolve in their own due time. \n The Full Moon on the 12th can bring sudden or unexpected social activity and epiphanies. It can liberate you from household responsibilities, for example, or it can bring a friend to you who wants your company or help. Alternatively, this can be a time to discover your feelings about a friendship or project. You\u2019ve been quite preoccupied with your personal life and work these days, and now you\u2019re being pulled out of your routine, nudging you towards a better balance. The Full Moon now is a reminder that giving back is rewarding. \n Communications of all kinds are emphasized, but especially those involving creative contacts, children, and romantic interests, and they are generally favorable. It\u2019s also a good time for self-promotion efforts, particularly through your creativity and clever ideas. \n While there is much focus on diversifying and enjoying yourself, you find it very easy to throw yourself into your own special projects and interests. It\u2019s difficult to find you in a state of boredom this month. Research and analysis can be fruitful and enjoyable. You are inclined to want to investigate matters. A satisfying work-life balance is entirely possible as you pay your work and personal life their due attention. Even so, at times this month, you may feel a little divided between keeping things light and fun or going in deep. \n Venus moves through your home and family sector all month and softens any rough edges around the home. You\u2019re combining work/chores and home life in beautiful, growth-oriented ways. It\u2019s also rewarding to connect with your past or childhood issues and work through them, and as you do, you feel healthier or more determined to improve your health. \n Favorable energy is with you for support, money, intimate connections, and personal appeal. You\u2019re feeling peaceful yet also gently challenged and ready to take action. You can be especially eager to change your life, particularly on a deep, internal level. \n From the 20th forward, more attention to work and routine is in the stars. The New Moon on the 26th brings further power to your work and health sector and encourages you to improve your habits and begin fresh with your routines. Lifestyle improvements are strongly favored after this New Moon. You\u2019re taking charge of your services, working environment, daily life, or health matters. Take stock of your plans and their developments now. \n Good experiences on the job are likely, especially in the last week of May. You are finding new ways to get along with others, and people are valuing your services. An idea can come to full bloom, and it can be about your health, daily affairs, chores, or work. Conversations or incoming news can lead the way to new beginnings. You have much to gain from what you see and discover now. You may have been wavering on a matter, trying hard to make sense of it, and now you\u2019re more precise about it, or at least you know where you stand on an issue, and it feels good! \n More: \n Monthly Horoscopes \u2013 Details \n \n More Daily Horoscopes \u2013 All Zodiac Signs: \n Select a Sign Aries Taurus Gemini Cancer Leo Virgo Libra Scorpio Sagittarius Capricorn Aquarius Pisces \n \u00a0 \n This Year: Capricorn \n 2025  Overview \n The year 2025 brings a fuller social life to your world, dear Capricorn.\u00a0 There\u2019s less pressure to prove yourself or perform this year, and more joy in plugging away at what you do best. Until June, watch that you don\u2019t overload your life with additional responsibilities. Otherwise, it\u2019s a strong period for truly enjoying your daily life and routines. Work should be quite available to you. While relationships with family can grow to be more demanding, 2025 is a year in which you are reminded how much you need others. Jupiter\u2019s presence in your opposing sign (Cancer) from June 9th forward is likely to bring helpful, happy people into your experience and, for some, a partner who deepens your happiness. Existing partnerships can bring joy. \n Overall health may improve, and wellness routines can spark joy this year. Communications are becoming far less pressured, and learning or personal interests and connecting can bring rewards. \n \n With Saturn transitioning into your solar fourth house this year, there can be times when you feel the walls are closing in on you with home or family. There can be a feeling of heaviness when it comes to your responsibilities or you literally feel cramped in your personal space. However, you have the chance to restructure your domestic world by bringing more order to it. But while Saturn wants you to be more organized in your home life, Neptune encourages you to bring more imagination to the equation. Uranus, too, is changing, and it asks for a more authentic approach to your routines and job. A more unconventional approach to your work or daily duties can be in store. Fortunately, you\u2019re able to create harmonious conditions that boost both your work and home life considerably. \n You can be very resourceful when it comes to recycling or using what you already own in different ways. You might find unique products to sell and market. Shifts in the distribution and sources of income are also likely this year. Partnerships may get off to a bit of a rocky start this year, but they improve many times over as 2025 advances, especially with better communication. \n More:  Capricorn 2025   or   \u2013\u00a0 2025 Preview \n \n \n This Year in Love: Capricorn \n 2025 Love Horoscope for Capricorn \n With your ruler, Saturn, transitioning into a new sign and Pluto now permanently out of your sign, dear Capricorn, it\u2019s an interesting year of discovery.

This one-year transit brings you delightful opportunities and benefits on a social level, particularly for one-on-one relationships. Many Capricorns will gain a new best friend or partner during this cycle that lasts from June 2025 to June 2026, and others will expand and enhance an existing close relationship. \n Jupiter is generally considered a lucky transit, but it\u2019s probably less about luck and more about magnification and expansion.

Until June, watch that you don\u2019t overload your life with additional responsibilities. Otherwise, it\u2019s a strong period for truly enjoying your daily life and routines. Work should be quite available to you. While relationships with family can grow to be more demanding, 2025 is a year in which you are reminded how much you need others. Jupiter\u2019s presence in your opposing sign (Cancer) from June 9th forward is likely to bring helpful, happy people into your experience and, for some, a partner who deepens your happiness. Existing partnerships can bring joy. \n Overall health may improve, and wellness routines can spark joy this year. Communications are becoming far less pressured, and learning or personal interests and connecting can bring rewards. \n \n With Saturn transitioning into your solar fourth house this year, there can be times when you feel the walls are closing in on you with home or family. There can be a feeling of heaviness when it comes to your responsibilities or you literally feel cramped in your personal space. However, you have the chance to restructure your domestic world by bringing more order to it. But while Saturn wants you to be more organized in your home life, Neptune encourages you to bring more imagination to the equation. Uranus, too, is changing, and it asks for a more authentic approach to your routines and job. A more unconventional approach to your work or daily duties can be in store. Fortunately, you\u2019re able to create harmonious conditions that boost both your work and home life considerably. \n You can be very resourceful when it comes to recycling or using what you already own in different ways. You might find unique products to sell and market. Shifts in the distribution and sources of income are also likely this year. Partnerships may get off to a bit of a rocky start this year, but they improve many times over as 2025 advances, especially with better communication. \n More:  Capricorn 2025   or   \u2013\u00a0 2025 Preview \n \n \n This Year in Love: Capricorn \n 2025 Love Horoscope for Capricorn \n With your ruler, Saturn, transitioning into a new sign and Pluto now permanently out of your sign, dear Capricorn, it\u2019s an interesting year of discovery. On the one hand, you feel considerably less pressure, and on the other, you\u2019re feeling fresh and full of initiative. \n Your love life is likely to pick up the pace in the second half of 2025, with expansive Jupiter entering your partnership sector on June 9th. This one-year transit brings you delightful opportunities and benefits on a social level, particularly for one-on-one relationships. Many Capricorns will gain a new best friend or partner during this cycle that lasts from June 2025 to June 2026, and others will expand and enhance an existing close relationship. \n Jupiter is generally considered a lucky transit, but it\u2019s probably less about luck and more about magnification and expansion.

You're seeking a little more harmony and balance in your life with this transit, and with the Moon's harmony with Saturn, it seems very much within your reach. Having the support of steady, mature Saturn is a blessing. While Saturn seems to work quietly and without fanfare, its gifts are valuable and long-lasting. Saturn recently began its transit of your solar third house, where it will visit until September 1st and then from February 2026 to April 2028. This cycle challenges you to channel your energies more constructively. You might take up structured learning or bring more discipline to your work or studies.

Some distancing yourself from others might occur with new interests and responsibilities, however.

You're also paying due attention to your domestic world, perhaps feeling prouder of your personal life, or you're recognizing the need to center and anchor yourself. Communications are more straightforward, and you're connecting well with others and your personal interests this month. \n Where there were delays or extended periods of limbo recently, blocks lift in May. Slowdowns for you primarily revolved around communications, transportation, love, and money. May is vibrant, and while it promises some ups and downs, energy flows more smoothly. Financial gain could come from communications or siblings, and so can love opportunities. \n Still, Pluto turns retrograde in your sign on May 4th, and this retrograde cycle will last until October. As the shift occurs now, there can be some magnification of unresolved matters, fears, or compulsions. However, once you get beyond this change of direction, the months-long retrograde cycle is excellent for detaching yourself from these things enough to see where you may have been overly worried or obsessing. You\u2019re in a fine position to review and reassess your approach to self-starts, new beginnings, career matters, and responsibilities. If you\u2019ve been over-controlling, you recognize this now and want to take some of the pressure off. \n You are in a strong position to improve \u2014 and enjoy \u2014 your home life and family relationships this month. A fair part of you needs to recoup, regenerate, and decompress this month. However, you begin to crave special attention, fun and games, romance, or hobbies and recreation as May advances. You want to shine! \n Around the Full Moon on the 12th is an eye-opening period. You can make some exciting discoveries, but you\u2019re also likely to be called to action if you\u2019ve been too heavily engrossed in your personal life. The Full (Flower) Moon occurring at the top of your solar chart plays a big role in this \u2014 you may be called to task, or simply required to fill a responsibility or take the lead now. It may be a time of a promotion, culmination, or the turning point of a project, recognition, a new title, status change, or award. \n Renovations, redecorating, and making improvements that allow more freedom as well as organization and comfort on the home front can have long-lasting results. A lot is going on on the inside again this month. \n There can be a competitive feel to your partnerships as Mars moves in opposition to your sign all month, and you may be putting more energy into your relationships than usual. Watch for a tendency to instigate or rile up a significant other or to treat a partner as a rival. There can be a tendency for you or a partner to be touchy or for arguments to emerge seemingly out of nowhere. You\u2019re at your best when you work with someone towards a common goal. Perhaps the ideal way to use this energy to your advantage is to allow others to inspire and motivate you. Team up and take action so that excess energy turns outwards. This can be a passionate, revealing time. \n Helping you out is Venus in harmony with your sign all month. This position does wonders for your personal appeal. Relationships are smoother as you put more effort into communication or better structure your personal interests to accommodate other pursuits and connections. It can be a good time to humble yourself to the need for improved connections and communication, which helps you in many different life departments. Your words can get you closer to others, at least in spirit. Collaboration can be excellent, and sharing a piece of work, joining a workshop, furthering a cause, or communicating with a new friend can be in happy focus. \n From the 20th forward, there is a growing focus on entertainment, romance, and creative self-expression. You\u2019re likely to end the month far more outgoing and confident than you began it. The New Moon on the 26th is an energizing, empowering one as it brings a feeling of rejuvenation or a fresh start with enjoying and expressing yourself. \n The last few days of the month are good for gaining some clarity about creative projects, a relationship, or a hobby. You\u2019re taking more pride in your work, ideas, and beliefs. Creative projects could reach a turning point, or there can be a romantic revelation related to a matter that has been developing for some time. An honest, open vibe, especially in your love relationships, is also satisfying. \n More:  Monthly Horoscopes \u2013 Detail \n \u00a0 \n \n \u00a0 \n This Year: Aquarius \n You are working harder this year at communicating more effectively and building your level of expertise, dear Aquarius. In 2025, you will delve deep into your true motives and feelings about practical matters, with the potential to make significant changes in your work life. While the steps you take may not be giant or quick, they can lead to a better understanding of what you can and want to do in your work. At the same time, there\u2019s an edgier quality to your personality, which can subtly change your relationships and pursuits. \n Not everyone knows this about your sign, but you take your career, income, and service to others to heart. You need to feel good on a deep level about what you do in order to feel good about yourself. The focus this year is on really enjoying what you do. Although work can bring joy, it can also involve some challenges. Be sure to carefully discriminate what you take on with new work or projects. Fortunately, this year can bring opportunities to your door, especially for work and reputation boosts. \n But 2025 is certainly not all about work, especially until June when new avenues for entertainment and self-expression open up to you. All year, you are working on growing past stubborn attitudes and beliefs, communicating more mindfully, and changing deeply ingrained habits and systems. \n You are becoming quite dissatisfied with sloppy learning or holes in your thinking and want to refine your skills and knowledge this year. There is more of this energy next year and beyond, but you\u2019re getting a taste of it now. Financially speaking, you are moving away from a spiritual, somewhat passive approach and towards a more active, slightly more risk-taking approach to making money. You will no longer sit back and wait for it to come to you. \n With Pluto in your sign, you\u2019re learning about your personal power, sometimes through complicated life lessons and experiences. This year, Pluto will have the greatest impact on Aquarians born approximately January 21-23, who will be taking a deep look within as they uncover facets of their personality that they haven\u2019t yet accepted or even acknowledged, and this can be uncomfortable at times but ultimately rewarding. \n Uranus has been a long-term guest in your home and family sector, and it is transitioning into your creativity sector this year. The move will be complete next year, but in 2025, you\u2019re getting a taste of this energy. You can attract exciting and unusual people into your creative, recreational, or romantic world, although permanency is in question. Your tastes can vacillate. Exploring new hobbies or different forms of leisure and entertainment can be in focus. Creatively speaking, you will be blossoming this year and beyond \u2013 you will discover new and unique forms of creative expression. \n More:  Aquarius Yearly Preview Horoscope for 2025  or  Aquarius  for 2025 \n \u00a0 \n \n \u00a0 \n This Year in Love: Aquarius \n \u00a0 \n 2025 Love Horoscope for Aquarius \n Love and pleasure are headlines for you in 2025, dear Aquarius.

It can also bring more opportunities to date and connect with others romantically. \n These are not necessarily the types of relationships that lead quickly to commitment, but they\u2019re enjoyable and confidence-boosting.

You're bringing more muscle and motivation to your health and wellness or self-care programs. If you\u2019ve been putting off going for a check-up or slowing down on fitness, for example, this is a time for getting back into action. You want to take charge. At times, the need to initiate, lead, and work independently can stir up competition or conflict with others, so do what you can to either tone things down a little or prepare yourself for a battle or two, depending on which you prefer! \n However, May also features a pleasant focus on your personal interests, money matters, and home and family life. It also feels smoother. Most of the slowdowns or confusing moments in recent months are behind you now. May promises you steady forward motion. Clarifications and advances related to finances, business, communications, and transportation tend to figure strongly now. These things improve, flow naturally, and pick up momentum this month. You know what you want, and you\u2019re picking and choosing your projects more mindfully. \n You can often find yourself knee-deep in studies, personal interests, writing, speaking, errand-running, and connecting this month. You can be very influential or persuasive in your communications, guidance, or teachings with the Sun in your solar third house to the 20th and Mercury there from the 10th to the 25th. \n May can be a big idea month, and it\u2019s quite excellent for reaching out to others, although there can be times when you feel you have too much on your plate, and you can be a little scattered as a result. Dealing with errands and short trips may be more frequent but can also lead to some nice opportunities. \n Around the Full Moon on the 12th, you can experience significant epiphanies and make personal discoveries. It's a time to connect with and release feelings that were previously held at bay or pushed down deep. Even though any Full Moon can feel heavy or draining, it can also be a time of release, liberation, announcements, and projects reaching a turning point. This one can feature a culmination of studies, published works, or the need for travel, adventure, or freedom to discover and explore things beyond your routine. \n Still, Pluto begins its yearly retrograde this month, and with the shift happening, you might experience some intensifying fears, worries, or frustrations. Rest assured, these things should settle down shortly. The retrograde lasts until October, and it encourages you to observe and understand your attachments and fears. You may not have noticed how concerns, guilt, and control issues have worked against you. Now that you\u2019re making these associations, it\u2019s easier to work on healing and resolving problems. \n You can be super-motivated this month to reach health and work goals, and you\u2019ll stop at nothing to improve on past performance. You tend to want to set your own pace and goals, and you thrive on the small challenges you create for yourself now. \n You are more of a free agent this month, and you are likely to come up with more ideas and plans than you can count. However, you should definitely watch for committing to more of these than you can reasonably manage. Finances are clearer. There can be nice prospects involving your income, family or home life. The desire to make yourself and/or your loved ones more secure motivates you. Business timing improves, and you may want to get creative with your work or routines. \n The last week of the month brings a New Moon and the chance for a new beginning. Since the 20th, you've been more domestic-focused, and the New Moon helps you formulate goals in this area. There can be standout, meaningful conversations about or with family. Things may be coming together on the home front or regarding living conditions, and ideas can blossom. You are taking pride in your ability to handle personal matters! It's a wonderful time for pouring more heart into your domestic world. \n More:  Monthly Horoscopes \u2013 Details \n \n \u00a0 \n This Year: Pisces 2025 \n The year ahead is stronger for your relationships, in general, dear Pisces, and especially love and fun friendships. You\u2019re also a lot more grounded and confident as Saturn begins its transition out of your sign. Ideally, you use the transit of Jupiter to your solar fourth house until June to the utmost \u2013 filling your inner well and strengthening ties with loved ones. This way, by June 9th, you can bring more natural confidence to a new cycle that involves exploring your playful, dramatic, and creative side. \n The year 2025 is strong for home improvements, updates, upgrades, and boosts. Making your life more secure and safe can be a huge motivator. Certainly, your definition of comfort, abundance, security, and pleasure is evolving this year and the next. Working from or on the home can be in the spotlight. \n Love is easier this year. Romantic, playful, and casual relationships in the second half of the year are in the spotlight. New avenues for recreation, amusement, creative expression, and hobbies can open up. Pursuing your joy comes more naturally. \n Saturn is beginning its transition into your money and values sector this year, which can promote a feeling that you\u2019re pinched in the money department, but this can serve to motivate you to work harder and save more. With Uranus moving into your home and family sector, there can be some shuffling around, redecorating, a move, or experiences that have you doing your domestic world differently. \n Neptune, your ruler, has been visiting your sign for many years, but is now beginning its slow exit. You\u2019re closing chapters on a spiritual quest for meaning and a period when you tended to go with the flow. As Saturn moves on from Pisces as well in 2025 and 2026, your personality is lighter, freer, and less pressured. \n The year brings increased feelings of security and joy in your home life, a stronger sense of confidence emanating from within, and wonderful channels for enjoying and expressing yourself. \n More:  2025 Pisces   or  2025 Pisces  \n \u00a0 \n \n \u00a0 \n This Year in Love: Pisces \n \u00a0 \n 2025 Love Horoscope for Pisces \n The year ahead is one of many shifts, dear Pisces, including your modern ruler, Neptune, beginning the process of heading out of Pisces. Neptune doesn\u2019t change signs very often! As such, you can experience a shift as you adapt to this transition. You\u2019re feeling more determined and can be more outgoing. Another sign that you\u2019re coming out of your shell: Jupiter, the planet of expansion, moves into your romance sector on June 9th. It\u2019s a love-friendly cycle that also finds you more expressive and playful. \n Until then, Jupiter spends time in your family, home, and soul sector, which is a strong influence for living conditions and happiness on the domestic front. Your joy and happiness levels at home or with family get a real boost. \n While it\u2019s not explicitly strong for romantic relationships, if you use this gentle, quiet transit well and look very carefully for opportunities, you can better prepare yourself for the more overt opportunities of the upcoming Jupiter transit that begins in June 2025. This is about learning to be more comfortable in your own skin. Slowly, you are building up your confidence\u2026 cont\u2019d \n More:  2025 Pisces Love Horoscope \n Special note concerning Covid-19 \n Special note: \n Astrological transits continue in their cyclical ways no matter the current situation. They should always be adapted to what\u2019s going on in your life in sensible ways. This applies at all times, but is particularly relevant now during this health crisis. During the quarantines, if the planetary transits are suggesting it\u2019s a great time to socialize, for example, it makes sense to adapt this to online socializing. Let\u2019s be safe and protect one another through social distancing, when possible. Much love, Annie (March 18, 2020) \n My heart goes out to all those experiencing difficulty.
