Senior Software Engineer,High Wire Payments,Remote,remote,2025-06-27,Indeed,"Job Summary
We’re hiring a senior engineer to lead the backend integration of a Fintech-powered payment processor, starting with full API connectivity between two existing platforms, and potentially growing into a long-term technical leadership role within our organization.
We are launching a white-labeled payment processing solution and require a full integration between our existing IRISCRM (NMI’s Merchant Central) platform another large Fintech’s API Platform (Fintech company would be disclosed upon hiring). It will require functionality such as Merchant Onboarding, KYC Integration, Merchant Settlement, and Disputes APIs.
Most of the User Interface is already in place and functioning within our existing CRM platform, and your job is to build the “glue” between IRIS and Fintech, likely requiring setting up a PCI compliant data warehouse in between the two platforms. The system must support merchant creation, underwriting/KYC, recurring billing, compliance checks, disputes handling, and financial reporting but as mentioned above the CRM tool will already support most of this functionality natively. You’ll have access to detailed API documentation and will be collaborating with engineers at Fintech, who will help ensure the integration meets certification standards.
The scope starts with building a merchant onboarding and transaction layer between Fintech and IRIS. This includes implementing webhooks, managing SFTP-based reporting, and supporting high-volume transaction throughput (thousands per hour). You’ll also advise on architecture decisions, such as vaulting, net billing, fraud and risk handling, and partner fee management.
The client values autonomy, pace, and precision, they move fast, communicate often, and need someone who’s not only a strong coder but also a structured thinker. They’re open to candidates based globally, but cultural alignment with a US-based, high-performance team is essential.
Long-term, this platform will likely evolve to include AI-native features and spin off other fintech projects.
This role could scale into a CTO-style position depending on performance and interest.
Duties
Lead integration between Fintech’s APIs and IRIS CRM for merchant onboarding, KYC, disputes, and reporting.
Design backend architecture including vaulting, compliance, and high-volume transactional flows.
Scope project milestones and define any additional hiring needs (e.g. frontend, QA).
Work directly with Fintech engineers to ensure technical certification and adherence to best practices.
Manage version control using tools such as GitHub or SVN, ensuring proper documentation and tracking of changes.
Facilitate regular team meetings to discuss progress, challenges, and solutions, fostering an open communication culture.
Weekly code presentation/reviews with other members of the team.
Requirements
Senior backend/API engineering experience.
Strong knowledge of payment processing systems.
Experience with multi-tenant SaaS systems and compliance-heavy environments
Able to lead architecture decisions and execute hands-on development.
Excellent English and communication skills; must be confident engaging with US clients and partners.
Team leadership experience or interest in a path toward CTO-level responsibilities
Experience with APIs and software engineering best practices.
Proficient in version control systems like GitHub or SVN.
Excellent problem-solving skills and the ability to work under pressure.
Strong leadership abilities with experience in managing teams effectively.
Nice to have
Experience with IRIS CRM or other payment/merchant management platforms
AI/ML familiarity, especially for fraud detection, document review, or risk scoring
Previous work in high-risk verticals or regulated financial systems
Work Highlights
Duration: Initial 3-6 months of work with potential to expand into broader leadership role
Workload: Full-time
Start date and required time zone overlap: ASAP, with consistent overlap to US business hours (EST/PST preferred)
Join us in this exciting opportunity to lead a talented team while contributing to cutting-edge projects that make a difference. We look forward to your application!

Partner closely with other developers on your scrum team with the support from many others across the organization.
Keep up with new technologies and approaches to solve problems and improve existing systems.
Work directly with designers, QA, and our back-end developers in a dedicated scrum team to fully realize the product vision.
Participate in a well-oiled 2 week agile system to continuously add new features & functionality to the business.

Willingness to learn new technologies and grow as a developer
Ideally, you’ll also have a meticulous eye for design and rigorously check your own work for quality and precision, even before QA and stakeholder review
Publishing or digital media experience (including work with WordPress) preferred but not required
Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science, Computer Engineering, Information Technology, or a closely related technical field or foreign equivalent
