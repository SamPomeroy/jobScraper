Software Engineer - Frontend,Pano AI,"Remote in San Francisco, CA","remote in san francisco, ca",2025-06-29,Indeed,"Who we are

The problem: Every minute matters in fire response. As climate change amplifies the intensity of wildfires—with longer fire seasons, dryer fuels, and faster winds—new ignitions spread faster and put more communities at risk. Today, most wildfires are detected by bystanders and reported via 911, meaning it can take hours to detect a fire, verify its exact location and size, and dispatch first responders. Fire authorities need a faster way to detect, confirm, and pinpoint fires so that they can quickly respond—preventing small flare-ups from becoming devastating infernos.

About Pano: Pano AI is a 100+ person growth stage start-up, headquartered in San Francisco, that is the leader in early wildfire detection and intelligence, helping fire professionals respond to fires faster and more safely—with the right equipment, timely information, and enhanced coordination—so that they can stop a new ignition before it grows. Pano AI combines advanced hardware, software, and artificial intelligence into an easy-to-use, web-based platform. Leveraging a network of ultra-high-definition, 360-degree cameras atop high vantage points, as well as satellite and other data feeds, Pano AI produces a real-time picture of threats in a geographic region and delivers immediate, actionable intelligence.

MIT Technology Review listed Pano as one of the top 15 climate tech companies to watch in 2024 and Fast Company named Pano AI one of the Top 10 most innovative companies in AI of 2023. We’ve also been featured in the Wall Street Journal, Bloomberg, CNBC News, and a national TV commercial produced by strategic partner T-Mobile. Pano AI’s dozens of government and enterprise customers span 10 states in the U.S., five states in Australia, and BC, Canada, helping protect more than 30 million acres of land. Pano AI has raised $89M in venture capital funding from Giant Ventures, Liberty Mutual Ventures, Tokio Marine Future Fund, Congruent Ventures, Initialized Capital, Salesforce Ventures, and T-Mobile Ventures.

Senior Front-End Vue Developer,Corporate Tools,"Remote in Austin, TX","remote in austin, tx",2025-06-29,Indeed,"Overview:
Corporate Tools is seeking a highly skilled Senior Front-End Vue Developer with deep expertise in the Vue.js framework, for $150,000/year. You will be a traditional company employee. This is a full-time 40 hour/week position with company benefits. This is a remote position.
As a Senior Vue Developer, you will focus on the technical implementation and optimization of our Vue.js applications, ensuring they are high-performing, scale-able, and maintainable. This role is perfect for someone who enjoys solving complex front-end problems and working with large-scale Vue.js code bases. You’re also someone who believes there are new tricks to learn and things won’t be done the same way tomorrow as they were done today. Not only do you enjoy learning new technology, you’re enthusiastic about sharing those technologies with others. If this sounds like YOU, we want YOU to apply!
What’s in a title?
Here at Corporate Tools we don’t take titles very seriously. We know for recruiting purposes we need to call our jobs something, so we started with labeling and differentiating them in a fair and transparent way with “junior, mid, senior”. However, we realized that was putting our employees in a box and wasn’t allowing us to uniquely identify their individual contributions, strengths, and professional goals. Once you join our team, titles get chucked as we expect everyone to work when everyone is ready regardless of title or experience. We have taken the approach of evaluating candidates and employees on a “level” basis. It makes it a little easier internally to talk about growing into the next level without there being this huge chasm between what it means to be a Junior Engineer vs. a Mid Engineer. Our levels have expectations set for each one and it’s the responsibility of the manager and employee to make sure there is alignment. We do this through quarterly conversations where we discuss employee progression. If the work is challenging, and to ensure they feel fairly compensated for their work and expertise. Basically, this gives us more flexibility to help people grow in their careers. But sure, you can post your title on LinkedIn as what makes sense to the rest of the world.

Android App Developer,Corporate Tools,"Remote in Austin, TX","remote in austin, tx",2025-06-29,Indeed,"Overview:
Corporate Tools is hiring a Android App Developer for $120,000/year. You will be a traditional company employee. This is a full time 40 hour/week position with company benefits. This is a remote position. Our main office is in Spokane WA, and we have satellite offices in Austin TX and Salt Lake City UT. At this time we are only able to support employees that are US residents. Sorry!
Are you really into mobile development? We’d like to be able to say we truly are into mobile development and have put the proper resources into building a vibrant mobile group of developers. As of today, we’re no where close to where we’d like to be and we’re looking for inspired folks to help us play in mobile as well as possible. Might that be you?
We run a number of business tool apps that help people at all stages of their business with various services and tools. From domains, phones, emails, business entity maintenance, business licenses, mail received on their behalf, etc. It’s complex and we service millions of users.
The largest problem you’ll be trying to solve is running our Phone App. We run a second phone line app mostly for businesses but we fancy ourselves as the most private, encrypted way to send messages and do phone calls that exists. Think Whats App and Google Voice, but without it being free so the big evil corporations can get your meta data. Running a second phone line and keeping our users communications as private as possible on hardware that is meant to not provide any privacy to the user on infrastructure and telecommunications that are meant to not provide any privacy to the users is our largest challenge. But it’s a war we firmly believe in.
But our apps today are embarrassing and shows our lack of focus on mobile… We’re ready for a change. It’s been hard to service so many clients at our pace of growth and put the focus on mobile that we wish we would have done a decade ago. With our organization structure, size, and resources we have today, we’re ready, even if it’s a decade late.
If you’re up for a challenge, working with fun good humans, and into doing good work. We’d love to talk

Software Engineer - Frontend,Pano AI,"Remote in San Francisco, CA","remote in san francisco, ca",2025-06-29,Indeed,"Who we are

The problem: Every minute matters in fire response. As climate change amplifies the intensity of wildfires—with longer fire seasons, dryer fuels, and faster winds—new ignitions spread faster and put more communities at risk. Today, most wildfires are detected by bystanders and reported via 911, meaning it can take hours to detect a fire, verify its exact location and size, and dispatch first responders. Fire authorities need a faster way to detect, confirm, and pinpoint fires so that they can quickly respond—preventing small flare-ups from becoming devastating infernos.

About Pano: Pano AI is a 100+ person growth stage start-up, headquartered in San Francisco, that is the leader in early wildfire detection and intelligence, helping fire professionals respond to fires faster and more safely—with the right equipment, timely information, and enhanced coordination—so that they can stop a new ignition before it grows. Pano AI combines advanced hardware, software, and artificial intelligence into an easy-to-use, web-based platform. Leveraging a network of ultra-high-definition, 360-degree cameras atop high vantage points, as well as satellite and other data feeds, Pano AI produces a real-time picture of threats in a geographic region and delivers immediate, actionable intelligence.

MIT Technology Review listed Pano as one of the top 15 climate tech companies to watch in 2024 and Fast Company named Pano AI one of the Top 10 most innovative companies in AI of 2023. We’ve also been featured in the Wall Street Journal, Bloomberg, CNBC News, and a national TV commercial produced by strategic partner T-Mobile. Pano AI’s dozens of government and enterprise customers span 10 states in the U.S., five states in Australia, and BC, Canada, helping protect more than 30 million acres of land. Pano AI has raised $89M in venture capital funding from Giant Ventures, Liberty Mutual Ventures, Tokio Marine Future Fund, Congruent Ventures, Initialized Capital, Salesforce Ventures, and T-Mobile Ventures.

Department

Compensation
$180K – $200K • Offers Equity
In accordance with applicable law, the following represents Flatfile's reasonable estimate of the range of possible compensation for this role if hired in Colorado.

Overview
Product Engineer - Front End
Flatfile is full of builders driven by a dual desire to make cool stuff and create tangible value. We pride ourselves in obsessing over the details but also grounding our decision-making and pace in whether we’re doing what’s in the best interest of our end users.
This is an exciting role because it sits at the nexus of everything we’re doing at Flatfile. Whether it’s leveraging AI to transform data, optimizing the performance of our data table (Turntable), or building new collaborative features into our workflow product, this role has a broad scope of impact.
This role reports to: Jon Bell, VP of Product
Why are we hiring for this now?
Flatfile is a post-product market fit AI company with rapidly accelerating growth, tons of runway, a lean, hungry, and sharp team playing for a huge outcome. We’re closing massive enterprise deals and evolving our platform quickly to scale with the growing demand. We have an ambitious roadmap ahead of us and need someone excited to lead the charge on many of these customer-impacting projects.
We want you to be a part of this.
In this role, you will:
Build new user-facing features with beautiful and scalable UI components
Work closely with design to implement fast new feature concepts (trust us, there are a lot)
Implement complex React components from drag & drop to the virtualized rendering of large data collections
Evolve the real-time collaborative editing to our data experience
Improve application performance by profiling
Shape new patterns with design for how autonomous agents are represented in the context of work-centric interfaces
Implement state-of-the-art cross-browser testing to ensure our user experiences work every time, for every user
Make effective trade-offs that balance business priorities with user experience, driving sound technical decision-making across the organization
Consider applying if you have:
Significant experience in a production environment, with significant contributions to the design, architecture, and optimization of elegant product experiences.
Expertise in frontend technologies, specifically Typescript, Javascript, React, and CSS.
Demonstrated capability to innovate and optimize at the system level.
Led all phases of software development, including ideation, product specification, prototyping, designing, and implementation. This role has a mix of both hands-on development as well as lead/architecture work.
A proven track record of raising the bar for technical standards, performance, reliability, and operational excellence.
Operate at an unreasonable pace.
Capacity to do large amounts of meaningful work quickly with little direction or oversight
While many Engineering roles are similar, Flatfile’s Engineering roles are unique. With that in mind, you should pass on applying if:
You don’t want to own decisions on how to approach technical problems and expect a lead or manager to make the final call. Our leads and managers provide feedback, but you will ship what you build and be accountable for it.
You refrain from engaging in or find it challenging to handle debates about the future state of products. We need someone who can have an opinion yet remain open-minded.
You prefer to avoid challenging the status quo or pushing the boundaries of technical possibilities, as this role demands continuous learning and adaptation to new technologies.
You’ve never worked in a fast-paced environment. We move quickly, and if you get frustrated when priorities change rapidly, we’re not the place for you.

What technology will you work with?
React + Typescript as primary drivers for our flagship, single-page
Blend of Tailwind CSS and Styled-Components for styling of our internal, Storybook managed design systems
Heavy use of React Context and Zustand + Immer for state management
Tanstack React-Query for data fetching and cacheing
Primarily REST backend with some SSE based endpoints - All built with NestJS
Home-grown data buffer cache for managing paginated data sets built with Typescript, React Hooks, and Browser Events
PubSub event system which influences UI behavior and real-time data (actively being transitioned to home-grown SSE framework)
Typescript service-workers used for client-side data management and runtime previews
Vercel's AI SDK for agentic chat interactions and message management

Your work will deliver direct customer value while also contributing to the platform by building reusable patterns and primitives that other teams at Vanta can adopt to drive activation in their respective areas.
Additionally, you'll play a key role in unlocking new business opportunities for Vanta. You’ll help build out patterns that support product trials, enabling customers to try before they buy and empowering partner teams to create effective trial experiences.

About Vanta
We started in 2018, in the wake of several high-profile data breaches. Online security was only becoming more important, but we knew firsthand how hard it could be for fast-growing companies to invest the time and manpower it takes to build a solid security foundation. Vanta was inspired by a vision to restore trust in internet businesses by enabling companies to improve and prove their security.From our early days automating security monitoring for compliance standards like SOC 2, HIPAA and ISO 27001 to creating the world's leading Trust Management Platform, our vision remains unchanged.

Software Engineer - Frontend,Pano AI,"Remote in San Francisco, CA","remote in san francisco, ca",2025-06-29,Indeed,"Who we are

The problem: Every minute matters in fire response. As climate change amplifies the intensity of wildfires—with longer fire seasons, dryer fuels, and faster winds—new ignitions spread faster and put more communities at risk. Today, most wildfires are detected by bystanders and reported via 911, meaning it can take hours to detect a fire, verify its exact location and size, and dispatch first responders. Fire authorities need a faster way to detect, confirm, and pinpoint fires so that they can quickly respond—preventing small flare-ups from becoming devastating infernos.

About Pano: Pano AI is a 100+ person growth stage start-up, headquartered in San Francisco, that is the leader in early wildfire detection and intelligence, helping fire professionals respond to fires faster and more safely—with the right equipment, timely information, and enhanced coordination—so that they can stop a new ignition before it grows. Pano AI combines advanced hardware, software, and artificial intelligence into an easy-to-use, web-based platform. Leveraging a network of ultra-high-definition, 360-degree cameras atop high vantage points, as well as satellite and other data feeds, Pano AI produces a real-time picture of threats in a geographic region and delivers immediate, actionable intelligence.

MIT Technology Review listed Pano as one of the top 15 climate tech companies to watch in 2024 and Fast Company named Pano AI one of the Top 10 most innovative companies in AI of 2023. We’ve also been featured in the Wall Street Journal, Bloomberg, CNBC News, and a national TV commercial produced by strategic partner T-Mobile. Pano AI’s dozens of government and enterprise customers span 10 states in the U.S., five states in Australia, and BC, Canada, helping protect more than 30 million acres of land. Pano AI has raised $89M in venture capital funding from Giant Ventures, Liberty Mutual Ventures, Tokio Marine Future Fund, Congruent Ventures, Initialized Capital, Salesforce Ventures, and T-Mobile Ventures.

Software Engineer - Frontend,Pano AI,"Remote in San Francisco, CA","remote in san francisco, ca",2025-06-29,Indeed,"Who we are

The problem: Every minute matters in fire response. As climate change amplifies the intensity of wildfires—with longer fire seasons, dryer fuels, and faster winds—new ignitions spread faster and put more communities at risk. Today, most wildfires are detected by bystanders and reported via 911, meaning it can take hours to detect a fire, verify its exact location and size, and dispatch first responders. Fire authorities need a faster way to detect, confirm, and pinpoint fires so that they can quickly respond—preventing small flare-ups from becoming devastating infernos.

About Pano: Pano AI is a 100+ person growth stage start-up, headquartered in San Francisco, that is the leader in early wildfire detection and intelligence, helping fire professionals respond to fires faster and more safely—with the right equipment, timely information, and enhanced coordination—so that they can stop a new ignition before it grows. Pano AI combines advanced hardware, software, and artificial intelligence into an easy-to-use, web-based platform. Leveraging a network of ultra-high-definition, 360-degree cameras atop high vantage points, as well as satellite and other data feeds, Pano AI produces a real-time picture of threats in a geographic region and delivers immediate, actionable intelligence.

MIT Technology Review listed Pano as one of the top 15 climate tech companies to watch in 2024 and Fast Company named Pano AI one of the Top 10 most innovative companies in AI of 2023. We’ve also been featured in the Wall Street Journal, Bloomberg, CNBC News, and a national TV commercial produced by strategic partner T-Mobile. Pano AI’s dozens of government and enterprise customers span 10 states in the U.S., five states in Australia, and BC, Canada, helping protect more than 30 million acres of land. Pano AI has raised $89M in venture capital funding from Giant Ventures, Liberty Mutual Ventures, Tokio Marine Future Fund, Congruent Ventures, Initialized Capital, Salesforce Ventures, and T-Mobile Ventures.

Organic and Paid Growth Specialist,Interaction Design Foundation,Remote,remote,2025-06-29,Indeed,"Are you a full-stack growth unicorn who knows how to craft educational, organic content that scales, launch high-impact campaigns, optimize paid ads, and own every step—from first impression to final conversion?
Can you blend storytelling, psychology, and analytics to craft irresistible content and campaigns that drive measurable growth?
Then we’ve got news for you: this might be exactly the opportunity you’ve been waiting for.
IxDF is a global leader in online UX/UI design education. Industry giants like Adobe and IBM trust our courses to train their teams, and prestigious universities such as MIT and the University of Cambridge use our materials in their curricula.
We’ve assembled an exceptional team of unicorns who support, inspire, and challenge each other every day. We wake up each morning excited to build a brighter future for millions of people around the world.
But something’s missing. And we think it could be you.
This is a role for someone who can “walk the talk.” We’re not looking for a self-proclaimed “brand ninja” or “marketing rockstar.” We want a builder, someone who knows how to get things done, shows proof, not pitch, and lives for measurable outcomes.
Do You Share the Vision of IxDF?
People don’t just buy our courses; they invest in a better version of themselves. That’s why every campaign and content piece we create must do more than “market.” It must reflect what we believe in as a brand:
Show the dream outcome: Help people imagine a future of creative, meaningful work, freedom, fulfillment, flexibility, and impact through great design.
Strengthen belief in success: Build confidence through real stories, practical roadmaps, and expert-led guidance. People should feel, “If they did it, I can too.”
Speed up the time to value: Offer instant wins. Make progress feel close and tangible not someday, but now.
Lower the effort barrier: Make it feel doable. No jargon. No overwhelm. Just human, beginner-friendly, bite-sized steps that meet people where they are.
Your job would be to translate this into headlines, hooks, content pieces, social media posts, campaigns, and data-informed strategy. You’ll create clarity, motivation, and momentum with a dash of unicorn magic.
What You Will Be Doing
You’ll be at the core of our growth engine, running and optimizing the systems that bring learners into our ecosystem. You will:
Create, own and scale organic content that earns attention, builds trust, and drives long-term growth across platforms.
Plan and execute high-impact campaigns for events like Black Friday, New Year, Unicorn Day, and Global Accessibility Awareness Day. You’ll turn briefs into successful results and reports into actionable insights.
Experiment with new channels like TikTok, Reddit, YouTube Shorts—launching quick pilots and scaling what works.
Build and maintain clear, concise documentation and reporting dashboards to make campaign operations more transparent, repeatable, and effective.
Use analytics to learn and iterate, not just report. Your campaigns get smarter every time.
Champion our value proposition—be a brand ambassador for our mission, bringing our voice, vision, and values to life across every touchpoint.
Run and scale paid media on Meta, Google, LinkedIn, and YouTube. From targeting to copywriting to ROAS tracking—you’ll own it all.
About you
You’re an optimizer, a problem-solver, and a builder. More specifically:
You bring storytelling and creativity to your work and can craft organic content that captures attention and connects with users.
You have a sixth sense for micro-copy, and the know-how to write persuasive, on-brand copy that drives action.
You have experience with launching campaigns across owned and paid platforms and have the track record to show it.
You are comfortable with platforms like Meta Ads Manager, Google Ads, and LinkedIn Campaign Manager, and you understand their constraints and superpowers.
You don’t just launch ads, you improve everything around them: the copy, the images, the funnel, the flow, the analytics.
You’re driven by impact and fluent in data - you use metrics to uncover insights, guide decisions, and optimize performance. But you also understand human behavior, platform psychology, and what makes a message truly land.
You view AI not as a threat or a substitution for that infamous human touch but as a force multiplier of your human capabilities. You use AI to build faster, smarter, and better results.
You have a keen eye for content, and you can quickly understand what type of content is meaningful, appropriate and useful in each situation or each platform.
You love structure and long-term thinking. Spreadsheets, naming conventions, campaign calendars, and systematic planning aren’t just useful to you — they’re how you think, build, and drive success.
You are fluent in written English with exceptional writing skills, grammar and an appreciation for the power of tone, brevity and microscopy.
You are based within the UTC -1 to UTC +3 time zone, which is crucial to ensure optimal collaboration and overlapping working hours.
Bonus points
You stand out if you...
Have experience creating or managing video-centric campaigns.
Know your way around GA4, GTM, and server-side tagging.
What We Can Offer
A full-time position, within a fully remote organization. Daily video-based collaboration with your colleagues from elsewhere on the planet, and you’ll get to meet up on team trips every year.
A work culture with no fluffy titles, political agendas and corporate drama. Your colleagues value your warm character, your strong work ethic, and the results you deliver. Junior or senior, if you embody old-school virtues of always striving to deliver results, learn and become better every day, you'll thrive at the IxDF.
A daily mission to help impact, empower, and enrich the lives of millions of people by creating affordable high-end design education for everyone across the planet. It’ll be yours too.
A company where the distance between idea and execution is minimal. We’re a highly agile organization with zero bureaucracy or corporate politics – and with exceptional order and efficiency.

At Talkiatry, that means our psychiatrists are in control of their practice. Our support staff focuses on removing administrative duties, enabling you to spend more of your time on patient care.

Talkiatry aims to bridge the current gap in outpatient psychiatry by providing high quality, respected medical care in a modern setting with modern tools.

Through proprietary technology developed by psychiatrists for psychiatrists, we empower you to treat the conditions and population you enjoy, building a practice you find both satisfying and intellectually challenging.

Talkiatry believes that psychiatric care should be affordable for patients and accepts all major insurance. As an integrated practice, we have a large in-house billing and patient care coordinator team that handles billing and administrative issues for our clinical staff.

Summary
We are looking for a systems professional to get our prototype working correctly, which is curently on a cloud host. The job in question is a project contract with set parameters, namely getting the website based interface up and running and producing output. There may be an opportunity in the future to direct development of an app interface instead of the current website based system.
Current technologies include:
Javascript (front end UI) - required
Python (back end system) - required
Ubuntu (current OS) - required
Blender 3D - nice to have
Experience with Hostinger - nice to have
The ideal candidate will have the following experience:
Experience with Ubuntu since this is the current OS of the system
Experience with getting a server online and making sure the javascript and python is working
Ability to take a system with little documentation and make sense of it through exploring the structure of it
Documenting a new system so that support can maintain it
Acting as an on call support in case of system issues
Requirements/what we need:
The server is stable and running, but the python scripts that use Blender as a backend do not seem to be rendering and creating an .MPEG file. It is also possible it IS rendering properly but it is not updating the UI to show so. This needs to be troubleshoot.
After this is fixed, we need to get the function that uploads the completed video to a user's Google drive or uploads to a private youtube channel working.
We need to extensively test the system end-to-end, we have scripts and a test plan for this but you will be the primary support person for this effort.
You have full freedom to make suggestions on how to implement our needs. For instance, if you want to port the OS over to a windows systems or redesign the architecture, this is fine as long as it passes integration tests and is documented.
100% remote ok, it would be really great if you were in the Columbus, Ohio area so we can collaborate in person occassionally.

Software Engineer - Frontend,Pano AI,"Remote in San Francisco, CA","remote in san francisco, ca",2025-06-29,Indeed,"Who we are

The problem: Every minute matters in fire response. As climate change amplifies the intensity of wildfires—with longer fire seasons, dryer fuels, and faster winds—new ignitions spread faster and put more communities at risk. Today, most wildfires are detected by bystanders and reported via 911, meaning it can take hours to detect a fire, verify its exact location and size, and dispatch first responders. Fire authorities need a faster way to detect, confirm, and pinpoint fires so that they can quickly respond—preventing small flare-ups from becoming devastating infernos.

About Pano: Pano AI is a 100+ person growth stage start-up, headquartered in San Francisco, that is the leader in early wildfire detection and intelligence, helping fire professionals respond to fires faster and more safely—with the right equipment, timely information, and enhanced coordination—so that they can stop a new ignition before it grows. Pano AI combines advanced hardware, software, and artificial intelligence into an easy-to-use, web-based platform. Leveraging a network of ultra-high-definition, 360-degree cameras atop high vantage points, as well as satellite and other data feeds, Pano AI produces a real-time picture of threats in a geographic region and delivers immediate, actionable intelligence.

MIT Technology Review listed Pano as one of the top 15 climate tech companies to watch in 2024 and Fast Company named Pano AI one of the Top 10 most innovative companies in AI of 2023. We’ve also been featured in the Wall Street Journal, Bloomberg, CNBC News, and a national TV commercial produced by strategic partner T-Mobile. Pano AI’s dozens of government and enterprise customers span 10 states in the U.S., five states in Australia, and BC, Canada, helping protect more than 30 million acres of land. Pano AI has raised $89M in venture capital funding from Giant Ventures, Liberty Mutual Ventures, Tokio Marine Future Fund, Congruent Ventures, Initialized Capital, Salesforce Ventures, and T-Mobile Ventures.

Data Analyst (Media Buying),V Shred,Remote,remote,2025-06-29,Indeed,"Why this role is important:
We run one of the most aggressive and dynamic performance marketing operations in the industry, spending six figures per day testing and scaling creatives across Meta, Google, and other paid channels. This is our first full-time Data Analyst dedicated to supporting media buying at this scale and your insights will be directly responsible for millions in ad spend decisions, funnel optimizations, and rapid “code red” response moments when performance dips.
What we’re looking for:
We’re looking for a highly analytical and detail-oriented Data Analyst to join our performance marketing team. This role is critical in driving insights across the entire funnel—from ad impression to click, to landing page behavior, and final conversion. You'll be responsible for uncovering trends and opportunities that help our media buyers and creative teams optimize campaigns for better performance. You’ll also play a critical role in troubleshooting “code red” moments when performance drops, helping to pinpoint root causes across ads, tech, and tracking.
Key Responsibilities:
Continuously analyze high volume campaign data across Facebook, Google, and other paid media platforms - often thousands of creatives and dozens of funnel variations weekly, identifying what’s working, what’s not, and why.
Identify trends, patterns, and actionable insights at the ad level, audience level, and funnel level
Own funnel analysis—monitor each stage of the user journey (impression, click, land, scroll, convert) to uncover drop-offs, optimization opportunities and anything that could lead to a decrease in performance
Own the first line of defense during ‘code red’ moments - flagging anomalies, investigating performance dips in real-time, and helping recover six figure per day ad accounts under pressure.
Conduct deep-dive analyses into post-click behavior using tools like Google Analytics, GA4, or similar platforms
Build scalable systems (dashboards, alerts, templates) to help media buyers, copywriters, and creative strategists make fast, data driven decisions without waiting for weekly reports.
Collaborate with tech/dev teams to troubleshoot data discrepancies, pixel issues, broken links, page speed problems, or attribution errors
Track key KPIs including CTR, CPC, CPM, ROAS, CVR, bounce rate, AOV, LTV, etc.
Partner with media buyers and creative teams to suggest testing ideas and scale successful campaigns
Evaluate landing page performance and suggest optimizations based on user behavior (heatmaps, scroll depth, bounce rates, etc.)
Support attribution modeling and funnel analysis to inform spend allocation and creative strategy
Clearly present insightsand findings to stakeholders in weekly and ad hoc reporting
Qualifications:
4+ years of experience in digital marketing analytics, preferably in performance marketing or ecommerce
Proficiency in Excel/Google Sheets and data visualization tools (e.g., Looker Studio, Sigma)
Strong experience with Facebook Ads Manager, Google Ads, and Google Analytics (UA and GA4)
Experience in diagnosing tracking issues, attribution breakdowns, and page-related performance drop-offs
Strong analytical mindset and ability to work under pressure during performance dips or outages
Understanding of tracking infrastructure (UTMs, pixels, conversions API, GTM, etc.)
Experience with post-click analysis tools (e.g., Hotjar or similar) is a plus
Excellent communication skills—you can turn complex data into simple insights and actions
Nice to Have:
Experience working directly with media buyers or CRO teams
SQL or basic scripting skills for querying data
Experience in A/B testing methodology and reporting
What Success Looks Like:
Your insights help us scale winning ads faster, kill losers earlier, and recover campaigns before performance losses compound.
You respond quickly and effectively during performance drops, helping resolve issues with minimal downtime
You bridge the gap between the marketing and tech teams, ensuring tracking, attribution, and page performance are always optimized
Your reports and insights drive confident decision-making across the team
You’ll Thrive in This Role If You...
Love solving puzzles under pressure and spotting patterns others miss
Are the type of person who catches data discrepancies before anyone else notices
Has experience of where to look first & identify root causes fast
Can translate dense performance data into “action bullets” for media buyers and creatives
Want your work to influence millions of dollars in daily ad spend
Prefer real-time testing environments over slow-moving reporting roles
Have leaned into leveraging AI in this field

Software Engineer - Frontend,Pano AI,"Remote in San Francisco, CA","remote in san francisco, ca",2025-06-29,Indeed,"Who we are

The problem: Every minute matters in fire response. As climate change amplifies the intensity of wildfires—with longer fire seasons, dryer fuels, and faster winds—new ignitions spread faster and put more communities at risk. Today, most wildfires are detected by bystanders and reported via 911, meaning it can take hours to detect a fire, verify its exact location and size, and dispatch first responders. Fire authorities need a faster way to detect, confirm, and pinpoint fires so that they can quickly respond—preventing small flare-ups from becoming devastating infernos.

About Pano: Pano AI is a 100+ person growth stage start-up, headquartered in San Francisco, that is the leader in early wildfire detection and intelligence, helping fire professionals respond to fires faster and more safely—with the right equipment, timely information, and enhanced coordination—so that they can stop a new ignition before it grows. Pano AI combines advanced hardware, software, and artificial intelligence into an easy-to-use, web-based platform. Leveraging a network of ultra-high-definition, 360-degree cameras atop high vantage points, as well as satellite and other data feeds, Pano AI produces a real-time picture of threats in a geographic region and delivers immediate, actionable intelligence.

MIT Technology Review listed Pano as one of the top 15 climate tech companies to watch in 2024 and Fast Company named Pano AI one of the Top 10 most innovative companies in AI of 2023. We’ve also been featured in the Wall Street Journal, Bloomberg, CNBC News, and a national TV commercial produced by strategic partner T-Mobile. Pano AI’s dozens of government and enterprise customers span 10 states in the U.S., five states in Australia, and BC, Canada, helping protect more than 30 million acres of land. Pano AI has raised $89M in venture capital funding from Giant Ventures, Liberty Mutual Ventures, Tokio Marine Future Fund, Congruent Ventures, Initialized Capital, Salesforce Ventures, and T-Mobile Ventures.

Commercial & Scientific Analyst New,KoBold Metals,Remote,remote,2025-06-29,Indeed,"About the company
The mining industry has steadily become worse at finding new ore deposits, requiring >10X more capital to make discoveries compared to 30 years ago. The easy-to-find, near-surface deposits have largely been found, and the industry has chronically under-invested in new exploration technology, relying on the manual techniques of yesteryear – even as demand accelerates for copper, lithium, and other metals to build electric vehicles, renewable energy, and data centers.
KoBold builds AI models for mineral exploration and deploys those models—alongside our novel sensors—to guide decisions on KoBold-owned-and-operated exploration programs. In the six years since founding, KoBold has become by far both the largest independent mineral exploration company and the largest exploration technology developer. Our data scientists and software engineers, who come from leading technology companies, jointly lead exploration programs with our renowned exploration geologists.
KoBold has proven its first discovery with materially less capital than the industry average and found one of the best copper deposits ever discovered: the copper is far more concentrated than the global average of copper mines, and this asset alone is expected to generate meaningful revenue for decades. KoBold has a portfolio of more than 60 other projects, each of which has the potential for another high-quality discovery.
KoBold is privately held; investors include institutional asset managers T. Rowe Price, and Canada Pension Plan Investments; technology venture capitalists Andreessen Horowitz, Breakthrough Energy Ventures, BOND Capital, and Standard Investments; and natural resources companies Equinor, BHP, and Mitsubishi.
We’re hiring a Commercial & Scientific Analyst to accelerate our mission.
About the position
In this role, you will report to a Lead or Manager within the Commercial Analytics team, and work closely within a remote team of 5 - 7 (across North America and Europe) to structure ambiguous problems, build financial and operational models, and provide recommendations to the C-suite for key decisions.
The work will span a variety of topics and include traditional market analyses such as creating supply/demand forecasts and writing commodity outlook reports, and non-traditional analyses as-needed to advance KoBold’s mission – e.g., operational and financial modeling for KoBold’s exploration programs, build vs. buy decisions for KoBold’s technology, mine economics modeling, and scientific communication materials for external audiences s, to name a few.
This is an ideal role for a recent graduate looking to acquire a wide range of skills very quickly. The learning curve will be steep, and the work will be varied and intellectually demanding.

Responsibilities
The Commercial & Scientific Analyst will:
Aggregate existing research and/or conduct original research to build forecasts and models related to commodity markets, KoBold operations, mine development, and more
Work with the Commercial Analytics and Financial Planning & Analysis team to answer strategic questions from leadership
Prepare materials for the Board of Directors and investors or partners
Use a first-principles approach in collaboration with various KoBold functions to help make decisions or improve operational efficiency (e.g., cost models for technology, HR, exploration programs, carbon emissions reporting, trade-off/sensitivity analyses)
Conduct analytics for critical workstreams in mine development and exploration
Build and maintain financial models assessing project economics
Support others on the Commercial Analytics team on various analytical assignments
Qualifications
A great candidate will have:
Education in a STEM discipline or economics is preferred (physics, chemistry, astronomy/astrophysics, or mathematics).
At least 1 year of experience in technology, natural resources, finance, or professional services
Experience with Python or other scientific computing language and/or financial modeling

JOB DESCRIPTION

Position Title: Python Developer
Reports to: IT Project Manager of Enterprise Solutions Line of Business
Subsidiary: Leisnoi Professional Services, LLC
Location: Remote
Job Status: Regular Full -Time

SUMMARY:
The U.S. Census Bureau, Demographic Systems Division (DSD) requires support for Python development services in support of DSD’s migration of survey processing systems from Statistical Analysis System (SAS) to Python.

The Python Developer will assist with the development and documentation of the rewrite of The Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) production processing system into a Python codebase. The scope of the SIPP Production processing consists of 200+ edit programs. Additionally, a revamped SIPP system, named SIPP Seamless, is currently in its planning phase. Therefore, the work outlined is for supporting the ongoing SIPP production system and the SIPP Seamless system.

As DSD migrates its infrastructure into the cloud, a CI/CD tool is required. Therefore, DSD is creating a collaborative space in GitLab for sharing Python code, where the developed code will reside, and pipelines can be established. The GitLab CI/CD will then need configuration and optimization to emulate current automation for the system.

Additionally, DSD is investigating leveraging a database to replace datasets that have thousands of variables. Therefore, converting the current SAS datasets into a normalized database structure is also in scope. The database research will evaluate the feasibility of replacing datasets to determine optimizations and efficiencies. In the event the database replacement is ideal, the Python Developer will be involved in developing the database design for the SIPP Seamless system.

The scope of work for this position is to provide support to the Income Surveys Programming Branch (ISPB) in The Demographic Systems Division (DSD) for the development of a Python-based system for performing demographic survey editing. DSD needs expertise in developing enterprise, Python solutions from a developer that can effectively cross-train existing staff based on their experience in advanced programming, knowledge of data structures, database experience, and version control familiarity. The Python Developer will work with DSD IT Specialists in an integrated team environment when performing services associated with this contract.

The Python Developer will perform knowledge transfers and training to keep current staff abreast of all activities they have performed and to share knowledge of products and techniques. Additionally, all procedural and development work performed requires clear documentation that can be replicated by current and future staff. This includes clearly documenting and verbally communicating through step-by-step procedures, presentations, explanations of Python coding, configuration settings with rationale, shadowing, and other techniques deemed appropriate by current staff and/or management to ensure adequate knowledge transfer. For technical demonstrations, the Python Developer will use a variety of skills and tools such as Python, SQL, PL/pgSQL, and Shell Scripting. For policy and procedural documentation, the contractor will create procedural documentation using software such as MS PowerPoint, MS Visio, MS Word, MS Excel, MS Teams, and MS SharePoint.

JOB DESCRIPTION

Position Title: Python Developer
Reports to: IT Project Manager of Enterprise Solutions Line of Business
Subsidiary: Leisnoi Professional Services, LLC
Location: Remote
Job Status: Regular Full -Time

SUMMARY:
The U.S. Census Bureau, Demographic Systems Division (DSD) requires support for Python development services in support of DSD’s migration of survey processing systems from Statistical Analysis System (SAS) to Python.

The Python Developer will assist with the development and documentation of the rewrite of The Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) production processing system into a Python codebase. The scope of the SIPP Production processing consists of 200+ edit programs. Additionally, a revamped SIPP system, named SIPP Seamless, is currently in its planning phase. Therefore, the work outlined is for supporting the ongoing SIPP production system and the SIPP Seamless system.

As DSD migrates its infrastructure into the cloud, a CI/CD tool is required. Therefore, DSD is creating a collaborative space in GitLab for sharing Python code, where the developed code will reside, and pipelines can be established. The GitLab CI/CD will then need configuration and optimization to emulate current automation for the system.

Additionally, DSD is investigating leveraging a database to replace datasets that have thousands of variables. Therefore, converting the current SAS datasets into a normalized database structure is also in scope. The database research will evaluate the feasibility of replacing datasets to determine optimizations and efficiencies. In the event the database replacement is ideal, the Python Developer will be involved in developing the database design for the SIPP Seamless system.

The scope of work for this position is to provide support to the Income Surveys Programming Branch (ISPB) in The Demographic Systems Division (DSD) for the development of a Python-based system for performing demographic survey editing. DSD needs expertise in developing enterprise, Python solutions from a developer that can effectively cross-train existing staff based on their experience in advanced programming, knowledge of data structures, database experience, and version control familiarity. The Python Developer will work with DSD IT Specialists in an integrated team environment when performing services associated with this contract.

The Python Developer will perform knowledge transfers and training to keep current staff abreast of all activities they have performed and to share knowledge of products and techniques. Additionally, all procedural and development work performed requires clear documentation that can be replicated by current and future staff. This includes clearly documenting and verbally communicating through step-by-step procedures, presentations, explanations of Python coding, configuration settings with rationale, shadowing, and other techniques deemed appropriate by current staff and/or management to ensure adequate knowledge transfer. For technical demonstrations, the Python Developer will use a variety of skills and tools such as Python, SQL, PL/pgSQL, and Shell Scripting. For policy and procedural documentation, the contractor will create procedural documentation using software such as MS PowerPoint, MS Visio, MS Word, MS Excel, MS Teams, and MS SharePoint.

Execute adversary emulation operations to surface risk in the organization
Work with partner teams to plan cooperative engagements
Lead and train operators
Communicate effectively with and directly support defenders
Present findings and operational work to groups in a clear and professional manner

Ability to replicate the tools and techniques of in-the-wild threat actors
Follows Threat Actor trends impacting organizational security
This position may be considered for a Remote or Hybrid (known internally at Target as ""Flex for Your Day"") work arrangement based on Target's needs.

Work Where It’s Best for You
Work Anywhere means you can work in an office or at home on any given day. It’s about getting the work done in the way and place that works best for each person. This applies across all locations and departments.
Work Anywhere does not mean work at any time. We have predictable core hours where employees are generally available for meetings and collaboration. Employees are focused and available during core hours.
We invest in our offices to make them places where our employees like to go. If you work in the office three or more days a week, you will have a dedicated office workspace. Our offices function as hubs to draw people in, create social bonds, and where random connections and mixing of ideas happen. We’re investing more in offices, culture, and offsite meetings, not less.
Product teams are organized in regional product hubs for optimal collaboration and live within a time zone of their hub. Our current product hubs are located in Pleasanton, Columbus, Boston, Kansas City, New York City, Raleigh, and Toronto. We create opportunities for teams to get together in person regularly.
Customer-facing roles, such as Sales and Professional Services, live near and/or travel to their customers.

As a leader in the industry, we have created and continue to foster relationships with all leading-edge technology companies servicing the Dental community.

With technicians on the ground throughout the country we offer in-person as well as remote support.
About You
Service first. Providing exemplary service means recognizing it. Have you put off a call to your cell phone company because the idea of waiting on hold, requesting a manager only to fight for a solution seems exhausting? Have you ever been pleasantly surprised by a service organization where your call is addressed efficiently, with care and acknowledgement that you are their top priority because you (as a client) are the lifeblood of their business? There is a huge difference in these approaches, and the latter builds loyalty and trust which is vital to the health of any business.
You are solution-oriented and accountable. When given an opportunity to address an issue you follow service standards and quickly provide a solution, if you can't you are able to escalate the issue and alert your manager to your need/want for knowledge and growth - all while communicating progress in a professional and engaging manner with the client.
Part of our team! While service tickets are addressed individually our crew is always ready to support one another, you will both receive and provide help as we are all working toward the same goal. Together we provide a level of service that our clients dream of and that we stand behind.

Chief Technology Officer,GMV,"Remote in Los Angeles, CA","remote in los angeles, ca",2025-06-29,Indeed,"Fully Remote | Offices available in Los Angeles & Houston
$275k-300k base, plus bonus + benefits
This isn't your typical job ad, and we're not looking for your typical CTO. Interested? Let's dig in.
1️⃣ Who we are

Our company was founded in 2006 specializing in all things technical for bus-based public transit systems in the US, then acquired by a larger Spanish firm in 2015. This means we design, manufacture, and manage all kinds of different products and features, including driver interfaces, dispatch communications, passenger counters, announcers, GPS tracking, and reporting & data analytics. It also means we build real-time information systems for riders including apps and digital signage found at bus stops. We have relationships with Apple Maps, Google Maps, Transit app, and our work goes out to millions of riders on those platforms. Our product is like air traffic control, but for buses. There are a mix of hardware and software products in this role. We hope this excites you!

The US-based division of the company has approximately 50 people. It’s the best of both worlds: small company feel with big company support. You’ll lead a team of 10 engineers (with room to grow) and responsibilities across front end, back end, embedded systems, and cloud infrastructure. You’ll be part of the product leadership team and senior management team and report to the Chief Product Officer.

This is our most senior technical leadership role in North America. You’ll directly manage engineering, own the technology strategy and execution, and work cross-functionally with other department heads to ensure company-wide alignment.

To learn more about our North America division, visit www.gmvtransit.com.

We are fully remote with offsites once or twice a year and physical offices that some folks choose to use in Downtown LA & Houston, TX. We’ll expect you to travel about quarterly for management or full-team meetings.
2️⃣ We’re here to serve customers
Our customers are public transit operators. Their customers are the transit riding public, which is often people who have far less than we do. Our job is to Make Transit Work for them. We take this mission very seriously, and to put it bluntly: we want a CTO who is here to solve problems and serve customers as our first priority. You must be prepared to be direct yet kind, assertive yet empathetic in advocating for technical solutions that are best for the customer. Expectations will be high for you to build and maintain internal relationships that help best meet external needs.

We don’t shy from tough internal conversations as long as it’s in service of our customers.
3️⃣ We’re looking for proven operational excellence
We’ve got a team of world-class engineers and are looking for a leader to guide us towards operational excellence. Your job is to bring clarity, rhythm, and accountability to the regular workings of our team.

You must have prior experience coaching growing teams with success in three key areas: reliable delivery of new features, ongoing system stability, and constructive relationships. To us, operational excellence means we have the ability to trust the delivery plans we make and the code we release to production. It’ll mean threading the needle between burdensome process and complete freedom, allowing engineers the space to develop creative solutions while collaborating and aligning on architecture and technical standards.

Our ideal candidate for this position has been a senior team lead / VP engineering / CTO for a smaller company and is comfortable with undefined process but experienced enough to level up our approach. You’ll have lots of authority and fewer guard rails, but expectations for your ability to manage uncertainty and institute operational excellence are high. We’re looking for a candidate who has coached technical leaders, led engineering offsites, and brought predictability to complex delivery pipelines.

You’ll build the process by which we go from idea to release with a clear sense of progress and high quality expectations.
4️⃣ Tech matters, but people matter more
We need someone who is empathetic, diplomatic, candid, direct, and kind, yet accountable. Listening skills are a must, personal relationships and 1-1's are vital. An even-ness of temperament and a professionalism of work ethic are the key ingredients. We'll expect you to provide peer references to help us evaluate this, and this is our #1 criteria.

.NET, C#, SQL, React, React Native, Android, iOS, Linux, Kubernetes, and more. Our stack serves our team and our team serves our users. Tech choices are made with people in mind. We build products for web users in an office, mobile users on the go, and bus drivers in a vehicle — our tech stack is as varied as our users. We’re looking for someone with experience across the stack, but more importantly who has proven ability to build and lead teams with varied expertise. We’re a small team with a wide stack and a product with a huge surface area, so we don’t adopt new technologies just for fun. You’ll be the guide ensuring that our architectural choices are long-term sustainable.
We make tech choices to best serve our customers with supportable, reliable, and continuously improving product functionality.
5️⃣ We’re an integrator of hardware and software

This isn’t your typical SaaS product just living in a web browser. We install rugged computers, displays, sensors, audio amplifiers, and more on vehicles. We connect to engine computers to read loads of data in real-time. We rely on flaky cellular connections to send data home. We have thousands of devices moving around all over the country. We believe that simple, readable code is good code – bringing clarity to the noisy environment in which it lives.

We’re looking for someone with hardware knowledge and experience delivering products for distributed devices. Whether it’s from IOT devices, automotive, robotics, audio, or other physical technology, it’s important to have a strong working knowledge of electricity and physical hardware. While we don’t expect previous experience in all of these areas, we need to know you can understand things like CANBUS, J1708, 12 vs 24-volt power, serial communications, video resolution, and speaker resistance.

At our core, we’re experts at putting together physical hardware with performant software, and you must be too.
6️⃣ Private cloud, public cloud, and hybrid

Our product is a multi-tenant solution that runs in the private cloud from an enterprise-grade data center. We own the hardware because it gives us the best control of cost and quality. We’re also running storage and backups in the public cloud via AWS, and we’re actively planning for the future of our environment, from disaster recovery to load balancing to SOC2-level cybersecurity. We’re looking for someone who understands the technical and business tradeoffs of public cloud hosting vs. running your own data center and has experience with both. You need to be able to craft and communicate long-term plans for site reliability that allow us to deliver an ever-expanding list of features to more customers while maintaining peak performance.

You think in systems. You can see how design decisions today affect supportability, reliability, and team velocity six months from now. You know how to scale not just infrastructure, but decision-making.

We take the long-term view of system architecture, and we want you to lay out the path forward.
7️⃣ You must be able to get your hands dirty when needed

We won't expect you to write code every day, but if you can't, you won't be able to manage and hold our team to its highest level of performance. You must be a senior engineer and prove it. In this role, you’ll build POCs, you’ll approve architecture designs, you’ll review code. You may even find yourself on a bus with our field team, and you need to be comfortable diving in to wiring and literally getting your hands dirty. We will have a practical test (and pay you for the time) and we expect you to demonstrate these abilities to us.

This is a hard requirement. We’re not looking for a hands-off manager.
8️⃣ Pay and Benefits

We can’t offer stock (not available from parent company), but we can offer cash comp, great benefits, and a career-making move for you.
$275k-300k plus 25% bonus potential
Generous health and dental benefits
Generous paid parental leave after one year
401k plan with company match
Flexible hours and location
Most of our work happens on Slack, but once or twice a year we get together in person to collaborate within and across our teams. Our company is a small one with great culture, and you're going to have fun being a part of it.
You’ll have the chance to leave your mark on a mission-critical industry, shape a high-performing team, and define how we scale.

This is the kind of role that turns a great engineering leader into a transformational executive.
9️⃣ To apply, you must send more than a resume–we need to understand who you are

We don't need a formal sir or madam cover letter, but we do need to see you taking the application seriously, which means writing a note to us telling us why this job appeals to you and why you’ll appeal to us. Include specifics about your experience in our technologies (don’t just use keywords, tell us what clean code really means to you), why you believe you’re a strong leader, how you’ve built teams in the past, how you’ve driven operational excellence in those teams, and anything else that helps us get to know you as a person beyond your resume.

In addition to completing the online application, email your note and resume to the hiring manager directly: careers-na [AT] gmv [DOT] com with the subject ""Chief Technology Officer."" The letter you write for us will be 10 times more valuable than your resume in getting our attention.

If you have any questions please do not hesitate to contact Pablo Durán Álvarez, in charge of this vacancy.

Software Engineer - Frontend,Pano AI,"Remote in San Francisco, CA","remote in san francisco, ca",2025-06-29,Indeed,"Who we are

The problem: Every minute matters in fire response. As climate change amplifies the intensity of wildfires—with longer fire seasons, dryer fuels, and faster winds—new ignitions spread faster and put more communities at risk. Today, most wildfires are detected by bystanders and reported via 911, meaning it can take hours to detect a fire, verify its exact location and size, and dispatch first responders. Fire authorities need a faster way to detect, confirm, and pinpoint fires so that they can quickly respond—preventing small flare-ups from becoming devastating infernos.

About Pano: Pano AI is a 100+ person growth stage start-up, headquartered in San Francisco, that is the leader in early wildfire detection and intelligence, helping fire professionals respond to fires faster and more safely—with the right equipment, timely information, and enhanced coordination—so that they can stop a new ignition before it grows. Pano AI combines advanced hardware, software, and artificial intelligence into an easy-to-use, web-based platform. Leveraging a network of ultra-high-definition, 360-degree cameras atop high vantage points, as well as satellite and other data feeds, Pano AI produces a real-time picture of threats in a geographic region and delivers immediate, actionable intelligence.

MIT Technology Review listed Pano as one of the top 15 climate tech companies to watch in 2024 and Fast Company named Pano AI one of the Top 10 most innovative companies in AI of 2023. We’ve also been featured in the Wall Street Journal, Bloomberg, CNBC News, and a national TV commercial produced by strategic partner T-Mobile. Pano AI’s dozens of government and enterprise customers span 10 states in the U.S., five states in Australia, and BC, Canada, helping protect more than 30 million acres of land. Pano AI has raised $89M in venture capital funding from Giant Ventures, Liberty Mutual Ventures, Tokio Marine Future Fund, Congruent Ventures, Initialized Capital, Salesforce Ventures, and T-Mobile Ventures.

Research, write, and edit landing pages, blog posts, product copy, and campaign captions with both SEO and conversion in mind.
Run competitive keyword research and stay ahead of shifting VA policy, Google updates, and veteran search behavior.

Serious writing chops—concise, clean, compelling copy across long-form and conversion copy formats.
Strong understanding of the VA system, veteran culture, and the nuances of writing for this audience (personal or professional experience both welcome).
Fully capable of owning SEO tools and workflows: GSC, Ahrefs/SEMrush, Screaming Frog, Surfer, etc.
Deep knowledge of Google’s ranking signals, E-E-A-T, and modern content strategy.
You think in terms of outcomes—not tasks—and you’re the kind of person who pushes hard because it matters.
Why You’ll Like Working Here
We’re veterans helping veterans. That’s the mission. It’s real, and it matters.

Create and manage a backlog of experiments and optimizations (FAQs, content layout tweaks, video integration, CTAs, schema markup, and more).
Partner with Comms and external agencies on digital-PR initiatives that earn authoritative backlinks and brand mentions to amplify our brand search visibility.
Monitor and evaluate SEO performance, report on key metrics, and refine tactics based on insights.
How to be successful in this role:
You have 3-5+ years of SEO experience–preferably in a high-growth enterprise SaaS business–with a record of delivering measurable growth.
Proficiency in SEO tools, such as GA4, Google Search Console, SEMRush, Ahrefs, Sitebulb, etc.

You think like both a content strategist and engineer, balancing big-picture planning and refinement of defensible content systems.
You are excited about optimizing for LLMs and adapting to the new zero-click paradigm.
You are a strong collaborator and communicator who can build relationships with cross-functional teams and agencies.
Experience with programmatic SEO, YouTube SEO, and localization strategies is a plus

About Vanta
We started in 2018, in the wake of several high-profile data breaches.
