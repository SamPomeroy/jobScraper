Software Engineer - Frontend,Pano AI,"Remote in San Francisco, CA","remote in san francisco, ca",2025-06-29,Indeed,"Who we are

The problem: Every minute matters in fire response. As climate change amplifies the intensity of wildfires—with longer fire seasons, dryer fuels, and faster winds—new ignitions spread faster and put more communities at risk. Today, most wildfires are detected by bystanders and reported via 911, meaning it can take hours to detect a fire, verify its exact location and size, and dispatch first responders. Fire authorities need a faster way to detect, confirm, and pinpoint fires so that they can quickly respond—preventing small flare-ups from becoming devastating infernos.

About Pano: Pano AI is a 100+ person growth stage start-up, headquartered in San Francisco, that is the leader in early wildfire detection and intelligence, helping fire professionals respond to fires faster and more safely—with the right equipment, timely information, and enhanced coordination—so that they can stop a new ignition before it grows. Pano AI combines advanced hardware, software, and artificial intelligence into an easy-to-use, web-based platform. Leveraging a network of ultra-high-definition, 360-degree cameras atop high vantage points, as well as satellite and other data feeds, Pano AI produces a real-time picture of threats in a geographic region and delivers immediate, actionable intelligence.

MIT Technology Review listed Pano as one of the top 15 climate tech companies to watch in 2024 and Fast Company named Pano AI one of the Top 10 most innovative companies in AI of 2023. We’ve also been featured in the Wall Street Journal, Bloomberg, CNBC News, and a national TV commercial produced by strategic partner T-Mobile. Pano AI’s dozens of government and enterprise customers span 10 states in the U.S., five states in Australia, and BC, Canada, helping protect more than 30 million acres of land. Pano AI has raised $89M in venture capital funding from Giant Ventures, Liberty Mutual Ventures, Tokio Marine Future Fund, Congruent Ventures, Initialized Capital, Salesforce Ventures, and T-Mobile Ventures.

What started as a compliance-focused tool has since grown into a robust suite of products that help retailers and brands streamline operations, gain actionable insights, and connect with customers in more meaningful ways.

From small family-owned shops to publicly traded enterprises, AIQ serves businesses of all sizes, delivering scalable solutions that eliminate guesswork and empower smarter decision-making.

Born in the fast-moving world of legal cannabis, we’re no strangers to complex regulation and messy data. That’s where we thrive. Our roots in regulation make us creative, adaptable, and relentless in solving hard problems.

Tweak and expand our internal component library as needed
If you have React Native experience: help build, refactor, and optimize features in our mobile app (Expo)

Bonus: If you’re interested in full-stack work, there’s room to take on backend endpoints (Node or Go) to support your projects as you become more comfortable with our tech-stack and codebases. (Should not be expected immediately for most cases)

3+ years of React + TypeScript experience
React Native + Expo experience (this is important! But not required to apply)

Senior Front-End Vue Developer,Corporate Tools,"Remote in Austin, TX","remote in austin, tx",2025-06-29,Indeed,"Overview:
Corporate Tools is seeking a highly skilled Senior Front-End Vue Developer with deep expertise in the Vue.js framework, for $150,000/year. You will be a traditional company employee. This is a full-time 40 hour/week position with company benefits. This is a remote position.
As a Senior Vue Developer, you will focus on the technical implementation and optimization of our Vue.js applications, ensuring they are high-performing, scale-able, and maintainable. This role is perfect for someone who enjoys solving complex front-end problems and working with large-scale Vue.js code bases. You’re also someone who believes there are new tricks to learn and things won’t be done the same way tomorrow as they were done today. Not only do you enjoy learning new technology, you’re enthusiastic about sharing those technologies with others. If this sounds like YOU, we want YOU to apply!
What’s in a title?
Here at Corporate Tools we don’t take titles very seriously. We know for recruiting purposes we need to call our jobs something, so we started with labeling and differentiating them in a fair and transparent way with “junior, mid, senior”. However, we realized that was putting our employees in a box and wasn’t allowing us to uniquely identify their individual contributions, strengths, and professional goals. Once you join our team, titles get chucked as we expect everyone to work when everyone is ready regardless of title or experience. We have taken the approach of evaluating candidates and employees on a “level” basis. It makes it a little easier internally to talk about growing into the next level without there being this huge chasm between what it means to be a Junior Engineer vs. a Mid Engineer. Our levels have expectations set for each one and it’s the responsibility of the manager and employee to make sure there is alignment. We do this through quarterly conversations where we discuss employee progression. If the work is challenging, and to ensure they feel fairly compensated for their work and expertise. Basically, this gives us more flexibility to help people grow in their careers. But sure, you can post your title on LinkedIn as what makes sense to the rest of the world.
Wage:
$150,000/year
Benefits:
100% employer-paid medical, dental and vision for employees
Annual review with raise option
22 days Paid Time Off accrued annually, and 4 holidays
After 3 years, PTO increases to 29 days. Employees transition to flexible time off after 5 years with the company—not accrued, not capped, take time off when you want
The 4 holidays are: New Year’s Day, Fourth of July, Thanksgiving, and Christmas Day
Paid Maternity and Paternity Leave
Up to 5% company matching 401(k) with no vesting period
Quarterly allowance
Use to make your remote work set up more comfortable, for continuing education classes, a plant for your desk, coffee for your coworker, a massage for yourself... really, whatever
Open concept office with friendly coworkers
Creative environment where you can make a difference
No dumb benefits like free dog walking on the weekends that snobby hipster places have to make you feel cool, but mathematically won't cost the company much money because you won't use it
